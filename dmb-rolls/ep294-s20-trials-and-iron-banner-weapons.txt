// The Immortal (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, Rangefinder, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The base stats and perks are pretty stellar - Immortal has the highest range, stability and aim assist of any aggressive SMG. The out-of-the-box TTK is 0.75s for any resilience with 8 crits and 2 bodies, and the Accuracy Adjusted TTK is 0.83s (5c, 6b). You can push the range out all the way to 100 AND add Rangefinder on top of that with the right combination of perks and situation but, for the sake of control on a controller, you'll probably want to add a little stability into the mix or, at the very least, not penalise it. With that in mind, Smallbore is the top pick for the barrel perk, although Hammer-Forged Rifling and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives, with Ricochet Rounds the clear standout in the magazine. The roll that everyone's hot for is Rangefinder as the first trait column support perk and Target Lock as the signature perk in the second. Rangefinder's additional point of Zoom both pushes out your effective range and damage falloff, and constrains the recoil. Target Lock reduces the TTK down to 0.67s at 10 resilience (8c, 1b), and will melt anyone running 4 resilience or less on 0.53s with 8 crits, at the cost of having to commit to the engagement for the perk to proc - so no peek shooting! Alacrity is the best of the origin perks - when active it adds 20 range, 10 Aim Assist, 20 Stability and 50 Reload Speed. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Targeting Adjustor or Sprint Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// The Immortal (PvP backup roll)
// Full Bore, Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). Backup PvP pick for duelling. The base stats and perks are pretty stellar - Immortal has the highest range, stability and aim assist of any aggressive SMG. The out-of-the-box TTK is 0.75s for any resilience with 8 crits and 2 bodies, and the Accuracy Adjusted TTK is 0.83s (5c, 6b). You can push the range out all the way to 100 AND add Rangefinder on top of that with the right combination of perks and situation. Full Bore gives you the most range at the cost of 10 Stability - but we've got a trait perk for that - and 5 Handling, with Ricochet Rounds also the clear standout in the magazine. Dynamic Sway Reduction as the first column support perk has a natural synergy with Target Lock to keep your reticule on target, adding stability and accuracy with every shot that lands, so balancing the barrel stability penalties. Target Lock reduces the TTK down to 0.67s at 10 resilience (8c, 1b), and will melt anyone running 4 resilience or less on 0.53s with 8 crits, at the cost of having to commit to the engagement for the perk to proc - so no peek shooting!

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. The base stats and perks are pretty stellar - Immortal has the highest range, stability and aim assist of any aggressive SMG. The out-of-the-box TTK is 0.75s for any resilience with 8 crits and 2 bodies, and the Accuracy Adjusted TTK is 0.83s (5c, 6b).

With that in mind, Smallbore is the top pick for the barrel perk, although Hammer-Forged Rifling and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives, with Ricochet Rounds the clear standout in the magazine. For a kill-chaining roll, Kill Clip as your second trait column signature perk reduces the TTK to 0.58s (7c, 1b) - even faster than Target Lock. Pairing with this, Rangefinder's additional point of Zoom both pushes out your effective range and damage falloff, and constrains the recoil, or Encore pairs well with extra range, stability and accuracy on kills.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Astral Horizon has decent stats by comparison with other kinetic slot aggressive shotguns, and an excellent PvP perk pool. Smoothbore, since S17 when the pellet spread was drastically reduced, is by far the best barrel perk for pushing out your range without any real downside. Add in Accurized Rounds as the magazine perk, Slideshot as your support perk in the first trait column, and Opening Shot as the signature perk in the second, and you'll be touching 94 range when everything's active. That'll push your damage drop-off out to 6.5m when hipfiring. Alacrity is the best of the origin perks - when active it adds 10 range, 10 Aim Assist, 20 Stability and 20 Reload Speed. Recommended MW: you could go Range to push to 100 for an extra 0.2m, but a better option is probably Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.

// Astral Horizon (Adept) (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smoothbore, Accurized Rounds, Killing Wind, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Astral Horizon has decent stats by comparison with other kinetic slot aggressive shotguns, and an excellent PvP perk pool. Smoothbore, since S17 when the pellet spread was drastically reduced, is by far the best barrel perk for pushing out your range without any real downside. Add in Accurized Rounds as the magazine perk, Kill Chaining as your support perk in the first trait column, and Opening Shot as the signature perk in the second, and you'll be touching 94 range and 78 Handling after a kill. That'll push your damage drop-off out to 6.5m when hipfiring. Alacrity is the best of the origin perks - when active it adds 10 range, 10 Aim Assist, 20 Stability and 20 Reload Speed. Recommended MW: you could go Range to push to 100 for an extra 0.2m, but a better option is probably Handling, with an Adapt Handling mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Bite of the Fox (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, (Accurized Rounds, FLared Magwell), (Snapshot Sights, No Distractions), Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Bite of the Fox is still as good in Season 20 as when the original arrived in Season 4. Lowest (except for Revoker) Zoom of 43 so you have as good a view when ADSed as you're likely to get. Handling is the normal play for the barrel perk, and this is no different, so FLuted Barrel would be the barrel perk of choice. The magazine perk doesn't make a huge different - Accurized Rounds maxes the range and pushes aim assist out a bit - not that you should really need it, or Flared Magwell adds to reload speed if you pick up a brick. for your support perk in the first trait column, your preferred sniping style would dictate either Snapshot Sights for more aggressive play or No Distractions for holding down a lane. In the second trait column as your signature perk, Opening Shot is the standout choice, improving range and accuracy. The Skulking Wolf is an occasionally helpful trait to proc if you've taken damage before winning your duel. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your play style. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// The Hero's Burden (PvP first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, Accurized Rounds, Zen Moment, Dynamic Sway Reducaiton
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Adaptive SMGs are in a bit of a tough spot, with the same TTK as Lightweights but needing all crits to kill in 0.73s (12 crits, 0 body shots), a slower Accuracy Adjusted TTK of 0.86s (8c, 6b)  and no bonus to Mobility or movement speed. There's no Rangefinder either, to help with range so you'll have to use your barrel and mag perks to try and be competitive. Full Bore in the barrel gives you as much range as possible - we can recover the penalties to stability and handling, with trait and origin perks - together with Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork results in 21.35m ADSed range. If you're going to try and hit all headshots, you'll need as much help as possible - both Zen Moment and Dynamic Sway Reduction as your trait perks may seem like overkill but, it's probably the only way to stand a chance. The Suros origin trait is one of the best for PvP, adding 36 handling and 20% flinch resistance after a reload. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your play style. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// The Wizened Rebuke (PvP first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, Projection Fuse, Offhand Strike, Backup Plan
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. The revised Wizened Rebuke was always A-Tier, if you learned to pre-charge, but with Season 20, and the new perk pool, it's now solidly S-Tier. With only five bolts fired, so less recoil to control, you can go all into range on M&KB - Full Bore and Projectile Fuse being the barrel and battery choices. Offhand Strike as the support perk in the first trait column is unbelievably good as at v7.0.0.6 when hipfiring after a kill - the additional range, stability and accuracy procced mean you'll be mapping people out to 25m or so for 7s (so make sure to pick up a few special bricks first!). To get the ball rolling for kill-chaining, Backup Plan as your second trait column signature perk makes no difference to the number of bolts needed to kill, which remains at four, and drops the charge time down to that of an adaptive frame's when procced. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB

// Jorum's Claw (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Ricochet Rounds, Encore, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Jorum's Claw, like other adaptive pulse rifles, has an abysmal TTK of 0.93s out of the box, with 6 crits and 1 body shot, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 1.00s (4c, 4b), but is very sensitive to even the smallest of damage buffs - Radiant, for example, drops the TTK down to 0.6s (6c). The stats are a bit of a mixed bag, with the low Zoom of 17 being useful for closer-range engagements at the cost of limiting the range and damage drop-off. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot tidies up the Recoil Direction, and adds a useful bump to Handling too, and Ricochet Rounds rounds out Range and Stability. For kill-chaining, Encore as the first trait column support perk provides more stability, handling and accuracy after a kill, to make hitting your crits easier, and Golden Tricorn as the second column signature perk drops the TTK to 0.6s (5c, 1b) at one stack. It's not impossible to proc the second stack, with this being a solar weapon, which drops the TTK further to 0.53s (3c, 2b). Titans can build even further into a kill-chaining roll with Path of Burning Steps, as the damage stacks with Golden Tricorn.
