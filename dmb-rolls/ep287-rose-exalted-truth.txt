@description:Early thoughts on new S-Tier Hand Cannons

// Rose (PvP first choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Rangefinder, Smooth Grip 
// Rose (PvP first choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 287. First-choice PvP pick for mobile playstyle duelling. Unique subfamily of a Lightweight 140RPM Hand Cannon - adds 20 Mobility (so you only need 80 on your armour to hit 100), and a 6.25% speed boost. Great stats - 85 aim assist, 20 Airborne Effectiveness and 11 in the mag - plus it has an epic set of consistency traits in third and fourth columns, which makes virtually every combination interesting for duelling. Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. Fluted Barrel and Accurized Rounds with Smooth Grip and a Stability Masterwork get you a great shape. For a mobile playstyle, Slideshot layers Range and Stability, and Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Rose (PvP backup roll)
// Polygonal Rifling, Accurized Rounds, (Moving Target Elemental Capacitor), (Rangefinder, Eye of the Storm, Snapshot Sights, Explosive Payload), Smooth Grip 
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 287. Backup PvP pick for duelling. Unique subfamily of a Lightweight 140RPM Hand Cannon - adds 20 Mobility (so you only need 80 on your armour to hit 100), and a 6.25% speed boost. Great stats - 85 aim assist, 20 Airborne Effectiveness and 11 in the mag - plus it has an epic set of consistency traits in third and fourth columns, which makes virtually every combination interesting for duelling. Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks with a Smooth Grip and Handling Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. For pure duelling, your first trait column options are Moving Target for more aim assist, or Elemental Capacity with an Arc subclass for a huge boost to Handling or Void for Stability. In the second trait column, Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom, Eye of the Storm gives big boosts to crit-hitting stats in a gunfight, Snapshot Sights gets you ADSed and ready to shoot first in an exchange, or Explosive Payload extends your useful range and adds blinding flinch.

// Rose (PvP backup roll)
// Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, (Moving Target Elemental Capacitor), (Rangefinder, Eye of the Storm, Snapshot Sights, Explosive Payload), Smooth Grip 
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 287. Backup PvP pick for duelling. Unique subfamily of a Lightweight 140RPM Hand Cannon - adds 20 Mobility (so you only need 80 on your armour to hit 100), and a 6.25% speed boost. Great stats - 85 aim assist, 20 Airborne Effectiveness and 11 in the mag - plus it has an epic set of consistency traits in third and fourth columns, which makes virtually every combination interesting for duelling. Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks with a Polymer Grip and Stability Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. For pure duelling, your first trait column options are Moving Target for more aim assist, or Elemental Capacity with an Arc subclass for a huge boost to Handling or Void for Stability. In the second trait column, Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom, Eye of the Storm gives big boosts to crit-hitting stats in a gunfight, Snapshot Sights gets you ADSed and ready to shoot first in an exchange, or Explosive Payload extends your useful range and adds blinding flinch. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

Add a Smooth Grip and Stability Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon with an AE of 30. In-air duelling, means a highly mobile playstyle, so naturally pair with Slideshot for increased range and stability, or Perpetual Motions for Handling and Stability.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 287. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. S-Tier hand cannon as at v6.3.0.2 - a stat monster, although Aim Assist is a little low (but hey, you're in Trials because you don't need help to hit your crits, right?). Void energy, so you use this to build into your void 3.0 subclasses and exotics. As with all Adaptive Hand Cannons, optimal time to kill is 0.87s with (3 crits) out of the box. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks - Fluted Barrel and Accurized Rounds - with a Handling Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. Killing Wind and Rampage pair well to make follow-up kills easier - Killing Wind noticably improves gunfeel and Rampage x1 means you only need 2 crits and a body. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod, or an Adept Range, Stability or Handling mod, or an Adept Range, Stability or Handling mod depending on your preference.

For a duelling roll, Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom and Eye of the Storm gives big boosts to crit-hitting stats in a gunfight.
