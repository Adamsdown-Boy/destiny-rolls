@title:Season 18 Playlist weapson with @Critbuff
@description:Season of Plunder New Vanguard, Gambit and Crucible playlist weapons

// Pure Poetry (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), (Well-Rounded, Ensemble, Perpetual Motion), Eye of the Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. As with all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork. Out of the box TTK  of 1s with 2 crits and 1 body - the subfamily's low stability makes a third crit more difficult. Stats are average, so this won't replace a well-rolled Palindrome or Eyasluna. If you are duelling, then round out the stats with Fluted Barrel and Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell. Then, for duelling, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion fill out the stats nicely, and Eye of the Storm makes hitting your third shot in a gunfight easier. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. As with all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork. You have access to the best PvP Origin Perk in Suros Synergy in a solid Pulse Rifle subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.93s with the first bullet of a third burst (6 crits, 1 body), to a 0.6s six crit kill. Stats are on the low side, including a truly terrible Recoil Direction of 50, so you will need a Counterbalance mod even with Arrowhead Brake, but you'll also benefit from its reduction of 30 bounce intensity, so it's still the best barrel park. With the mag, Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell round out the stats, adding some needed Stability. For a duelling roll, look for Perpetual Motion and Eye of the Storm to keep your reticule on target and make your crits easier to hit in a gunfight.

// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), Dynamic Sway Reducation, Tap the Trigger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. For a duelling roll, it's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column - pair this with the Omolon origin trait and Tap the Trigger and you'll end up with a precision bullet hose no matter where you are in the magazine.

// Out of Bounds (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), Dynamic Sway Reduction, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for kill chaining. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. It's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column, which pairs with the Omolon origin trait to keep your bullets on target through the magazine, and Golden Tricorn is the best damage perk - one stack gets you to the 0.6s TTK and two stacks to 0.47s with 6 crits and 2 body shots. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller
