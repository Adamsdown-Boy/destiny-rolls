@description:PvP SMG picks as at S17 from the discussion between Kyt and Pattycakes

// Shayura's Wrath (PvP first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, Accurized Rounds, (Killing Wind, Tunnel Vision), Kill Clip
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Not available as at S17 unfortunately, but arguably the strongest legendary PvP SMG in the game. Strong stats - almost auto-rifle range is possible. Push out the range as far as you can, even to the detriment of stability with barrel, mag and masterwork - this is a precision frame with 95 recoil direction, so it fires straight up and down, and a 16 zoom scope helps constrain bullet spread when ADS. Killing Wind adds a host of boosts including more range or Tunnel Vision adds bonus Aim Assist after a kill, at which point Kill Clip reduces both optimal and body shot TTK by 25%. Masterwork: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Big Gambit perk pool, so it's worth using double Infamy reputation weeks to reset your rank a few times, and get the extra trait slot options, before focusing engrams. Push out the range as far as you can with barrel, mag and Masterwork. Rangefinder is the best trait to both push range out further, and constrain bullet spread. A damage-boosting trait in the last column helps with chaining in 6s.

// Submission (PvP first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, Accurized Rounds, Overflow, (Swashbuckler, Harmony)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Shapeable. Excellent base Airborne Effectiveness and the Lightweight frame helps your mobility stat, but could do with a bit more range. Push out the range as far as you can with barrel, mag and Masterwork. Overflow is great for kill-chaining, especially with a damage-boosting trait like Swashbuckler, or pair with another Harmony weapon in your energy slot to feed off each other's kills. Masterwork: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.

// Submission (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore), Overflow, (Swashbuckler, Harmony)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Shapeable. Excellent base Airborne Effectiveness and the Lightweight frame helps your mobility stat, but could do with a bit more range. Push out the range as far as you can with barrel, mag and Masterwork, mixing in stability if you need help to control the recoil. Overflow is great for kill-chaining, especially with a damage-boosting trait like Swashbuckler, or pair with another Harmony weapon in your energy slot to feed off each other's kills. Masterwork: Range or Stability, with a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.
