@title:Seraph Weapons
@description:Season 19's Season of the Seraph weapons

// Fire and Forget (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accelerated Coils, Surplus, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 289 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. This is the first widely available Aggressive Frame LFR. The three-bolt shot will one-shot whether they're all body shots (base 77 damage each) or you hit a crit (264 damage), and with an ammo pickup giving five bursts (as at Season 19 v6.3.0.4), that's good power ammo economy. Stats are comparable to to Stormchaser, but with 1 extra zoom, which will help push out your aim assist cone. It's still worth pushing out your range a bit further using your barrel - Hammer-Forged Rifling has no downsides. The mag and Masterwork should be directed to reducing charge time as far as possible with Accelerated Coils - you can afford to lose a little impact. There's not much in either of the trait columns for PvP, unfortunately. For a straight duelling roll Surplus is probably the best first column trait for some extra Handling and Stability, with Vorpal Weapon in the second helping out with your taking down Guardians in a super. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Tripwire Canary (PvP first-choice roll)
// Polymer String, (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), Archer's Tempo, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 289 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. The bow looks bugged as at v6.3.0.4 as the draw time floor seems to be set at 540ms, rather than the usual 500ms for Lightweight bows - your best draw time will be the same as a Precision Bow, but you'll have less accuracy and do less damage. However, there's still an interesting option to make a kill-chaining roll worth using. Use your bowstring to reduce draw time - Polymer String does that and adds in a little extra accuracy too, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching improve accuracy (at the cost of a little stability for FAS). The default choice of Archer's Tempo is in the first trait column - this applies a scalar so will reduce your draw time to 420ms after a precision hit. Swashbuckler is where this bow starts to shine. While not as effective as when it's on Biting Winds, a melee kill to proc Swashbuckler x5 plus any other 10% damage boost (for example, Radiant) will one shot crit for as long as the boost lasts.

// Disparity (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Accurized Rounds, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Flared Magwell), Eye of the Storm, Headseeker
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 289 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP, but you're still probably better off with Hakke Breach Armaments to take down Titan barriers. Lower stats than the only other kinetic slot aggressive pulse rifle, Sacred Provenance from Garden of Salvation, but this makes up with +1 Zoom, and some interesting PvP combinations. Out of the box TTK is 0.73s, but requires 8 crits and no body shots, which will be very difficult in practice. It's not possible to reduce the TTK significantly, no matter what damage boosts are applied, so aim to add to consistency and making the optimal TTK easier to achieve. The first thing to address is the recoil direction - Arrowhead Brake takes it straight to to 97, so is an easy choice. Accurized Rounds pushes out the range, or you can add to magazine size, stability, or a bit of both with Tactical Mag, Appended Mag or Flared Magwell. Eye of the Storm as your first trait provides passive handling and accuracy boosts just for taking damage in a gunfight, making use of the improved Headseeker trait easier, for hitting extra damage headshots after a body shot, and making the optimal TTK easier to hit, with 6c, 2b.

// Judgment of Kelgorath (PvP first-choice roll)
// Supercooled Accelerator, Accurized Rounds, Shot Swap, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 289 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. This is the first legendary aggressive frame glaive, with an on-paper glacial TTK of 1.33s in two shots - try tat in open play and you'll end up very dead, so you'll need to adjust your playstyle. This has a higher range than adaptive frames and good aim assist (although you can't hit a crit), but lower handling and shield duration. A lack of crits means glaives are surprisingly useful in aerial combat as accuracy angle penalties have less of an impact. Start by maxing the range with your haft and magazine - Supercooled Accelerator does this without harming your already poor shield duration, and then accurized rounds, and a range Masterwork get you to 100 for the best base bolt speed. There's not that much for PvP in the first trait column - Shot Swap can be very useful to overcome the poor handling. The real juice is in the last column - Surrounded when procced, not even needing the Enhanced version, will one-hit kill any resilience. Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Judgment of Kelgorath (PvP first-choice roll)
// Supercooled Accelerator, Accurized Rounds, Shot Swap, Impulse Amplifier
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 289 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. This is the first legendary aggressive frame glaive, with an on-paper glacial TTK of 1.33s in two shots - try tat in open play and you'll end up very dead, so you'll need to adjust your playstyle. This has a higher range than adaptive frames and good aim assist (although you can't hit a crit), but lower handling and shield duration. A lack of crits means glaives are surprisingly useful in aerial combat as accuracy angle penalties have less of an impact. Start by maxing the range with your haft and magazine - Supercooled Accelerator does this without harming your already poor shield duration, and then accurized rounds, and a range Masterwork get you to 100 for the best base bolt speed. There's not that much for PvP in the first trait column - Shot Swap can be very useful to overcome the poor handling. In the second trait column, Impulse Amplifier boosts the bolt speed further, for better hit registration.

The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. Rapid-fire LMG go brrrr... Rapid fires have a base TTK of 0.53s with 7 crits and 2 body shots, or an Accuracy Adjusted TTK of 0.6s (4c, 6b). Decent stats - aim assist and stability are relatively high. The LMG ammo economy means, if you're using one, you have to make the most of every shot. Push out the range with your barrel and mag with Hammer-Forged Rifling and and Accurized Rounds, or add in a touch of stability with Smallbore. Then Field Prep increases the rounds you pull from a power ammo brick, while Tap the Trigger benefits last for exactly the 0.6s that it should take you to a kill.
