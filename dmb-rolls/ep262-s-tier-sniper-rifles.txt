// Eye of Sol (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Snapshot Sights, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 262. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Decent across-the-board stats and a mid-strength zoom, and both origin traits can be useful for 3s and 6s. Look for range with barrel and mag, without damaging other stats. Snapshot Sights is still useful to be first to ADS, and Opening Shot maximises range and boosts aim assist when active. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod if you're more passive or Quick Access Sling mod if you're more aggressive. Tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-duel

// Silicon Neuroma (PvP first choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds), Snapshot Sights, Opening Round
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 262. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. The lowest zoom scope on an aggressive frame sniper, but the origin trait's not really any use in PvP, unfortunately. Look for range with barrel and mag, without damaging other stats. Snapshot Sights is still useful to be first to ADS and is essential with the low handling, while Opening Shot maximises range and boosts aim assist when active. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability (to help a little with flinch), with a Targeting Adjuster mod if you're more passive or Quick Access Sling mod if you're more aggressive.
