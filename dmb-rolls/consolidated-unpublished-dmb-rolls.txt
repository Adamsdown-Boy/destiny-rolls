//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 287 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Er856J2Tunt6GP8DxzK2X?si=db7944e1fcbd403d). First-choice PvP pick for mobile playstyle duelling. Unique subfamily of a Lightweight 140RPM Hand Cannon - adds 20 Mobility (so you only need 80 on your armour to hit 100), and a 6.25% speed boost. Great stats - 85 aim assist, 20 Airborne Effectiveness and 11 in the mag - plus it has an epic set of consistency traits in third and fourth columns, which makes virtually every combination interesting for duelling. Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. Fluted Barrel and Accurized Rounds with Smooth Grip and a Stability Masterwork get you a great shape. For a mobile playstyle, Slideshot layers Range and Stability, and Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

Great stats - 85 aim assist, 20 Airborne Effectiveness and 11 in the mag - plus it has an epic set of consistency traits in third and fourth columns, which makes virtually every combination interesting for duelling. Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks with a Smooth Grip and Handling Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. For pure duelling, your first trait column options are Moving Target for more aim assist, or Elemental Capacity with an Arc subclass for a huge boost to Handling or Void for Stability. In the second trait column, Rangefinder adds all the benefits of +1 Zoom, Eye of the Storm gives big boosts to crit-hitting stats in a gunfight, Snapshot Sights gets you ADSed and ready to shoot first in an exchange, or Explosive Payload extends your useful range and adds blinding flinch. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

Optimal TTK of 0.87s with 3 crits. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel - Fluted Barrel is best - and maximise your Airborne Effectiveness with Extended Mag. Add a Smooth Grip and Stability Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon with an AE of 30. In-air duelling, means a highly mobile playstyle, so naturally pair with Slideshot for increased range and stability, or Perpetual Motions for Handling and Stability. Your second column trait depends on whether you want to maximise your accuracy in-fight with Eye of the Storm or on your initial shot with Opening Shot.

S-Tier hand cannon as at v6.3.0.2 - a stat monster, although Aim Assist is a little low (but hey, you're in Trials because you don't need help to hit your crits, right?). Void energy, so you use this to build into your void 3.0 subclasses and exotics. As with all Adaptive Hand Cannons, optimal time to kill is 0.87s with (3 crits). Highest Airborne Effectiveness of any 140 HC so, with the right perks you could build into a mobile aerial playstyle. Fluted Barrel adds Handling and Stability, and Extended Mag adds AE. Perfect Float adds more AE just for being in combat and, let's face it, if you're in the air you'll probably be taking damage, so turn that into a benefit with Eye of the Storm.

Void energy, so you use this to build into your void 3.0 subclasses and exotics. As with all Adaptive Hand Cannons, optimal time to kill is 0.87s with (3 crits) out of the box. Look to get the "stepladder" of Range < Stability < Handling with your barrel and mag perks - Fluted Barrel and Accurized Rounds - with a Handling Masterwork, so you get a snappy, controllable, flinch-resistant hand cannon. For kill chaining, Killing Wind in the first trait column noticably improves gunfeel on a kill. Encore is an interesting second column pick - improve range with crit kills, or make crits easier with bodyshot kills. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

Void energy, so you use this to build into your void 3.0 subclasses and exotics. As with all Adaptive Hand Cannons, optimal time to kill is 0.87s with (3 crits). Highest Airborne Effectiveness of any 140 HC so, with the right perks you could build into a mobile aerial playstyle. Fluted Barrel adds Handling and Stability, and Extended Mag adds AE. Perfect Float adds more AE just for being in combat and, let's face it, if you're in the air you'll probably be taking damage, so turn that into a benefit with Eye of the Storm. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Adept Icarus Grip mod to increase AE to 47. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Stay Frosty
// Barrel and mag options
//Arrowhead Brake, (High Caliber Rounds, Flared Magwell)
// Arrowhead Brake takes the Recoil Direction to a controllable 85 and, with the high rate of fire, High-Caliber Rounds can put out some significant flinch as well as adding some range or, to pair with traits that require a reload to proc, Flared Magwell give the biggest boost to reload speed.
// Trait options
// (Tunnel Vision, Killing Wind, Encore), Desperado
// Desperado's increase in fire rate drops the optimal TTK to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy adjusted TTK to 0.8s (6c, 3b). You'll need to hit your headshots which Tunnel Vision helps with - also procced on reload. Alternatively, Encore or Killing Wind can both help with hitting your headshots for kill-chaining. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.
// (Killing Wind, Encore, Tunnel Vision), Headstone
// Headstone is a bit of a sleeper trait for Trials and PvP modes with revives, as the Stasis Crystal generated from a crit kill prevents accessing an orb, giving you a numberical advantage for longer, or you can break the crystals if anyone is nearby for Dragonfly-like AOE damage. Killing Wind and Encore proc on a kill to make hitting follow-up crits easier, for kill chaining. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.
// (Tunnel Vision, Killing Wind, Encore), Kill Clip
// Kill Clip on its own will allow you to two burst up to 4 resilience in 0.53s (5c 1b), or if you have any other damage boost triggered, like Radiant, will two burst up to 10 resilience. You'll need to hit your headshots which Tunnel Vision helps with - also procced on reload. Alternatively, Encore or Killing Wind can both help with hitting your headshots for kill-chaining. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.

// Cold Front
// Aggressive Frame with lowish stats by comparison with in-slot competitors, including a Zoom of 14 - one lower than its peers. If you already have a decently rolled Extraordinary Rendition, then you probably don't need to worry too much about saving a good roll. The Hakke origin perk can be useful in breaking Titan Barricades, you're finding them annoying! Optimal TTK of 0.77s with 8 crits and 2 bodies. 
// Barrel and mag options
// Hammer Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds
// Use your barrel, mag and masterwork to push out your range as far as you can without damaging any other stats. Hammer-Forged Rifling and Accurized Rounds are your best options for this.
// Trait options
// Tap the Trigger, Cascade Point
// Cascade Point is a Desperado-like trait procced like Harmony. It has a short window to use but reduces your optimal TTK to 0.5s (8c 2b) for kill-chaining. You still need to hit crit shots, and Tap the Trigger assists with controlling the poor stability. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling mod.
// (Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion), Rangefinder
// For duelling, use consistency traits in your firet column to help control the recoil, and Rangefinder to push your range and aim assist out as far as it will go. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.
// (Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion), Rampage
// One stack of Rampage will reduce your TTK to 0.67s (8c 1b), while either Tap the Trigger or Perpetual Motion will help control your recoil to hit your crits and also, for Perpetual Motion, add handling and reload speed. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.
// (Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion), Frenzy
// One stack of Rampage will reduce your TTK to 0.67s and make it easier to hit (6c 3b), while either Tap the Trigger or Perpetual Motion will help control your recoil to hit your crits and also, for Perpetual Motion, add handling and reload speed. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.

// Glacioclasm
// Aggressive Frame with the highest range and zoom, but the lowest aim assist and, with no Rangefinder, this can still be outranged by a Precision Frame with the perk. Unfortunately, you probably won't get much value out of either Origin trait unless you can pick up extra ammo in combat. You'll need to practice pre-charging as this is very slow firing - the TTK is 1.09s with four bolts - a rapid fire can get two shots off in the same time, and most primaries will kill you if you're charging out in the open. 
// Barrel and mag options
// Extended Barrel, Projection Fuse
// With High-Impacts only shooting five bolts you have less recoil to compensate for and can invest into range with your barrel, battery and Masterwork - Extended Barrel takes your recoil direction to 88 as well.
// Trait options
// Under Pressure, High-Impact Reserves
// You'll rarely have more than two shots you spawn with, so both Under Pressure, improving your stability and accuracy, and High-Impact Reserves, improves consistency by reducing the number of bolts to kill to three, will be pretty much permanently procced, for duelling. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod.
// Slideshot, Kickstart
// If you can master sliding while precharging (and that's a big if) with Slideshot and Kickstart, you can offset the sliding penalty to stability and boost your range, and reduce your charge time and boost damage by 20%, your TTK drops to 0.87s with three bolts. You only have the narrowest of windows to co-ordinate all those moving parts, though. Recommended MW: Range, with a Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// Under Pressure, Eye of the Storm
// You'll rarely have more than two shots you spawn with, so both Under Pressure, improving your stability and accuracy will be pretty much permanently procced, for duelling. And chances are that, once you step out while you're precharging, you'll start taking damage which means all the accuracy bonuses from Eye of the Storm will mean your bolts will have a much better chance of connext. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod.

// Avalanche
// Arrowhead Brake, Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Tap the Trigger
// LMGs aren't in any way meta as at Season 19. The optimal TTK is 0.53s with 5 crits and accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.67s (2c, 4b), out of the box. If you've got a decent Commemoration, Corrective Measure or Unwavering Duty tucked away, you don't need to worry about keeping a PvP roll of this, although the Aim Assist of 90 is very attractive! If you don't, sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and add range and stability wth Ricochet Rounds. With a limited number of rounds, you'll need to make the most of them so consistency perks like Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger will help with hitting headshots while duelling. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.

// Zephyr
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Duellist's Trance, Assassin's Blade
// Swords are not in any way meta as at Season 19, and are pretty much have all the same stats (except Bequest from the DSC Raid, or Quickfang). If you must use one, Jagged Edge gives you the greatest damage, Swordmaster's Guard maximises your heavy attack charge time, and Duellest's Trance and Assassin's Blade are the most PvP oriented traits for kill-chaining, improving its charge rate, efficiency, defence, movement speed, damage and lunge distance after your first kill. Reccomended MW: Impact with a Quick Access Sling mod.

//// Dark Decider
// Rapid-fire frame with in-band stats by comparison with other energy-slot peers. The Iron Banner origin trait can be very useful to keep you alive, post-gunfight as, with auto rifles you'll always likely be taking damage in a duel, or Veist Stinger adds ADS movement speed and the occasional magazine refresh - your choice. Optimal TTK of 0.77s with 10 crits, and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (6c 6b) at base.
// Barrel and mag options
// Arrowhead Brake, Accurized Rounds
// With the high rate of fire, you'll need both Arrowhead Brake and a Counterbalance Stock mod to get the recoil direction to 88. Accurized Rounds adds 1.5m range and aim assist falloff.
// Trait options
// Dynamic Sway Reduction, Rangefinder
// For duelling, pick consistency traits in the first and second column - Dynamic Sway Reduction adds 10 stability and increases your accuracy as you fire, while Rangefinder adds 1 Zoom, and an additional 2.5m of range. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// (Dynamic Sway Reduction Subsistence), Golden Tricorn
// For kill-chaining, Golden Tricorn x1 reduces optimal TTK to 0.67s (8c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.77s (6c, 4b) and, being an arc weapon, you have a halfway decent chance of proccing two stacks with a matching ability kill. This takes your TTK down to a ridiculous 0.5s (6c, 1b) and accuracy adjusted TTK to 0.67s (5c, 4b). Dynamic Sway Reduction adds 10 stability and increases your accuracy as you fire or, if you're on a real tear, Subsistence will prevent the need to stop and reload to make the most of your damage boost. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// Dynamic Sway Reduction, Dragonfly
// Dragonfly can make kill-chaining easier by proccing AOE damage on nearby opponents on a crit kill, and you have a combination of a big magazine and Dynamic Sway Reduction for clean-ups. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// Flared Magwell, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Voltshot
// Maybe not the obvious choice for PvP but, for kill-chaining, get a kill, use Flared Magwell and a Reload Speed Masterwork to reload as fast as possible, and then prepare for some memeable clips in sixes with Voltshot, using your big magazine and Dyamic Sway Reduction to clean up anyone caught in the blast. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.


// Gunnora's Axe
// Pretty decent stats for a slug shotgun except Aim Assistance, where it's pretty much similar to its peers in the energy slot - Bonechiller being the standout (and Heritage, obviously, in the kinetic slot). The Iron Banner origin trait can be very useful to keep you alive, post-gunfight if you're using this as a holdout weapon. 
// Build options
// Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Moving Target, Opening Shot
// If you're planning to ADS, Fluted Barrel increases your handling for snappier swap and ADS speed, Accurized Rounds pushes your range out, and a combination of Moving Target and Opening Shot adds 30 aim assistance, to nudge it towards a competitive stat total. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Hip-Fire Grip, Opening Shot
// If you're planning to hip fire - the range is compressed whether you're ADSed or not - Fluted Barrel increases your handling for snappier swap speed, Accurized Rounds pushes your range out, and a combination of Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot adds aim assistance, to nudge it towards a competitive stat total. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod.

// Albruna-D
// As with all playlist weapons in season, try to reset your reputation as many times as you can before you cash in your engrams, to get as many rolls with double trait options and maximise your chances of the roll you're looking for. Aggressive Frame snipers can obviously one crit anything in PvP - this has lowish stats with a reasonable 45 zoom, but some interesting perk combinations to compensate. The Iron Banner origin trait can be very useful to keep you alive, post-gunfight if you've taken damage. 
// Barrel and mag options
// Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds
// Fluted Barrel increases your handing for faster equip and ADS speed, and Accurized Rounds pushes out your aim assist a little.
// Trait options
// (Elemental Capacitor - Arc, Surplus, Perpetual Motion), Harmony
// In the first trait column you can get lots of gunfeel bonus perks depending on your playstyle, but we're specifically looking for more handling for the fastest swap speed possible - Elemental Capacitor with an Arc subclass gives you an always on handling bonus of 50, Surplus or Perpetual Motion bonuses depend on how actively you use abilities and keep moving. The playloop would be to use Harmony to get a kill with your primary weapon and then swap for the 20% damage bonus. On it's own that will body shot up to 4/5 resilience and with any additional damage bonus - say, Radiant - you can one shot to the body at any resilience. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// (Elemental Capacitor - Arc, Surplus, Moving Target, Perpetual Motion), (Snapshot Sights, Opening Shot)
// For a duelling roll, you can get lots of gunfeel bonus perks in the first trait column depending on your playstyle - Elemental Capacitor with an Arc subclass gives you an always on handling bonus of 50, Surplus or Perpetual Motion bonuses depend on how actively you use abilities and keep moving. In the second trait column, Snapshot Sights will help ADS speed further, or Opening Shot adds 20 Aim Assist and range - you preference as to what you prefer. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod.
// No Distractions, (Opening Shot, Eye of the Storm)
// For holding down a lane No Distractions if helpful to resist flinch, and Opening Shot adds 20 Aim Assist and range, or Eye of the Storm boosts your accuracy if you take damage. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod.

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvP first-choice roll) - also Adept rolls
// Build options
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Roads, Rapid Hit, Box Breathing
// Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First-choice PvP roll for duelling. The Omolon origin trait is great at the top of a magazine, where you should be getting your kills. Out of the box, optomal TTK is a slow 1.0s with 3 crits and a body or accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.33s (1c, 4b). The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (0.67s TTK - 2c, 1b) and two tap tap crit up to 8 resilience in 0.33s, as at Season 19 v6.3.0.2. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, for your first shot. It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit in the first trait column helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost). Recommended MW: Handling, with a Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.

Out of the box, optomal TTK is a slow 1.0s with 3 crits and a body or accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.33s (1c, 4b), so this is probably one to tuck away in case scout rifles ever get a buff.

// Wendigo - also Adept rolls
// (Volatile Launch, Quick Launch), (High-Explosive Ordnance, High-Velocity Rounds, Proximity Grenades), (Impulse Amplifier, Chain Reaction), Golden Tricorn
// PvP first-choice roll for kill-chaining. Unfortunately, none of the origin traits are particularly helpful in PvP - Vanguard's Vindication is the least worst of the bunch. You want your grenades to get to the target as fast as possible with as large a blast radius as possible, so take your choice of barrels, mags and Masterwork as far as your own preference is concerned, or for a slightly easier life, you can always go for Proximity Grenades. In your first trait column, Impulse Amplifier boosts velocity by 35% or Chain Reaction makes the most of your kills to damage anyone nearby, while Golden Tricorn gives a 15% damage boost after a kill, with no need to reload, extending the effective blast radius.

Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. This is the first widely available Aggressive Frame LFR. The three-bolt shot will one-shot whether they're all body shots (base 77 damage each) or you hit a crit (264 damage), and with an ammo pickup giving five bursts (as at Season 19 v6.3.0.4), that's good power ammo economy. Stats are comparable to to Stormchaser, but with 1 extra zoom, which will help push out your aim assist cone. It's still worth pushing out your range a bit further using your barrel - Hammer-Forged Rifling has no downsides. The mag and Masterwork should be directed to reducing charge time as far as possible with Accelerated Coils - you can afford to lose a little impact. There's not much in either of the trait columns for PvP, unfortunately. For a straight duelling roll Surplus is probably the best first column trait for some extra Handling and Stability, with Vorpal Weapon in the second helping out with your taking down Guardians in a super.

Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP. The bow looks bugged as at v6.3.0.4 as the draw time floor seems to be set at 540ms, rather than the usual 500ms for Lightweight bows - your best draw time will be the same as a Precision Bow, but you'll have less accuracy and do less damage. However, there's still an interesting option to make a kill-chaining roll worth using. Use your bowstring to reduce draw time - Polymer String does that and adds in a little extra accuracy too, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching improve accuracy (at the cost of a little stability for FAS). The default choice of Archer's Tempo is in the first trait column - this applies a scalar so will reduce your draw time to 420ms after a precision hit. Swashbuckler is where this bow starts to shine. While not as effective as when it's on Biting Winds, a melee kill to proc Swashbuckler x5 plus any other 10% damage boost (for example, Radiant) will one shot crit for as long as the boost lasts.

The Ambush origin trait provides extra range and handling for the first 2.5s of an encounter, with a 5s reset timer, so works well for PvP, but you're still probably better off with Hakke Breach Armaments to take down Titan barriers quickly. Lower stats than the only other kinetic slot aggressive pulse rifle, Sacred Provenance from Garden of Salvation, but this makes up with +1 Zoom, and some interesting PvP combinations. Out of the box TTK is 0.73s, but requires 8 crits and no body shots, which will be very difficult in practice. It's not possible to reduce the TTK much no matter what damage boosts are applied, so aim to add to consistency, and making the optimal TTK easier to achieve. If you want to push out your range a little more, and have a bit more stability to help control the recoil direction, Smallbore is your barrel of choice, with a Counterbalance Stock mod to help out too. Accurized Rounds pushes out the range, or you can add to magazine size, stability, or a bit of both with Tactical Mag, Appended Mag or Flared Magwell. The improved Headseeker trait, hitting extra damage headshots after a body shot, and making the optimal TTK easier to hit, with 6c, 2b is your best second column trait. While you're waiting to craft your own, Moving Target Rapid Hit or No Distractions work well in the first column to make hitting those crits a bit easier.

This has a higher range than adaptive frames and good aim assist (although you can't hit a crit), but lower handling and shield duration. A lack of crits means glaives are surprisingly useful in aerial combat as accuracy angle penalties have less of an impact. Start by maxing the range with your haft and magazine - Supercooled Accelerator does this without harming your already poor shield duration, and then accurized rounds, and a range Masterwork get you to 100 for the best base bolt speed. There's not that much for PvP in the first trait column - Shot Swap can be very useful to overcome the poor handling.

@description:Season 19's (Season of the Seraph) reprised IKELOS weapons with the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait

// IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore), Accurized Rounds, Subsistence, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 290 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6zujbQ3jq1QXNWXAljFS2U?si=5d5e2e8d00974c49). . First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Precision hand cannons have an uncompetitive, if easy to achieve TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 2 bodies. Pretty poor stats across the board - even maxing range will not make this play well, but if you're going to use it, that's the play with your barrel, mag and masterwork. If you are able to resist reloading though, with the high fire rate and aim assistance, you could use Focused Fury as your second trait column perk - five crits reduces your TTK to 0.67s (3c) - pair that with Subsistence in the first trait column, and you should be able to keep three tapping for the whole 11s. Otherwise, Frenzy or one stack of Golden Tricorn will do the same, but are a little more difficult use - Frenzy is easy to lose the buff if you go in to cover to recover, and Golden Tricorn x1 lasts for 7s.

First-choice PvP pick for in-air duelling. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Precision hand cannons have an uncompetitive, if easy to achieve TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 2 bodies. Pretty poor stats across the board - even maxing range will not make this play well, but if you're going to use it, that's the play with your barrel and masterwork. You can make this a contender for aerial use with Extended Mag and Air Assault, and proccing Golden Tricorn, Frenzy or Focused Fury, will reduce the TTK to 0.67 (3c).

Rapid-fire shotguns suffer from having the same two shots as other shotguns, but a worse effective range, limiting their utility.

Use this with a melee build, and Pugilist (returning 20% melee energy on a kill) with Swashbuckler (which extends the useful range when procced) is a natural pairing, but Grave Robber or Subsistence can also work well, depending on whether you're finishing or leading with your melee.

High Impact Auto Rifles have an out of the box TTK of 0.83s (6 crits 0 bodies) and accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (4c, 3b) as at v6.3.0.7. Decent stats across the board by comparison with its competitors. Arrowhead Brake tidies up the recoil direction and adds extra Handling, while Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability. Then, if you use Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger work together to keep your shots on target with a slew or stability and accuracy boosts.

Shapeable. As a Season 19 Vanguard weapon, you need to have as many resets as possible to stand a reasonable chance of a decent roll. The Veist Stinger Origin Trait can be useful in combat to keep the mag topped up passively. Lightweight SMGs have a base TTK of 0.73s (10 crits, 2 bodies) and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.8s (9c, 4b), as well of the boost to mobility. With a zoom of only 14, and an in-band set of stats, you'll never compete for range, so you might as well capitalise on what makes this SMG different. Increase your range, recoil direction and/or handling with your barrel park, and capitalise on the 900 RPM with High-Caliber Rounds to add flinch. Dynamic Sway Reduction adds stability and accuracy boosts to keep your reticule on target, and Target Lock can drop the TTK by shaving off a bullet.

In-band stats, but with a standout Airborne Effectiveness of 23. Sidearm ranges are highly compressed, so boost stability with your barrel and mag instead to make crits easier. In the first trait column, Zen Moment can help keep your reticule on target or Killing Wind adds handling and mobility after a kill. In the second column, Kill Clip is tempting - reducing TTK to 0.53s (4c, 1b) for 5s when reloading after a kill, but Golden Tricorn x1 is the same TTK (albeit with 5c), and is easier to proc, as it doesn't need a reload. Throw on a Surprise Attack mod, and Mechaneers Tricksleeves for a Hunter and in the right circumstances you can get down to a 0.27s TTK with three crits.

Precision Hand Cannons have an uncompetitive, but easy 1.0 TTK with 2 crits and 2 bodies against any resilience - but they really need their stats and perks to line up to be competitive as at v7.0.0.3. Unfortunately, the stats for the Officer Revolver aren't great - really the only thing it has that's different is the Rasputin's Arsenal origin perk which refunds 50% of your magazine when you break a shield, and the option to use Seraph Rounds. Start off with Smallbore to push out range and stability, and then build into an what makes this unique - Seraph Rounds for all of the benefits of High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing and Ricochet Rounds or maximise your Airborne Effectiveness with Extended Mag, and let the origin trait keep your mag topped up. To keep doubling down into an aerial playstyle, Air Assault, Perfect Float and an Icarus Grip mod mean you can hit 83 AE, which should give you enough of an edge in the air.

Dynamic Sway Reduction overcomes much of the gunfeel shortcomings and, in the last column Target Lock can reduce the TTK down to 0.67s up to 9 resilience, and with the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait refunding 50% of your magazine on a shield break, you should be able to move between encounters after a kill with a nicely topped-up magazine.

// Smallbore, Extended Mag, (Rapid Hit, Demolitionist), (High-Impact Reserves, Wellspring)

High Impact LMGs will kill any resilience in 0.67s with and easy 3 crits and 2 body shots - unfortunately, that's the same TTK as some competitive primaries and slower than most special weapons, so LMGs are in a tough place in PvP. If you do run one, you need to maximise the mag size to make sure you're getting as many shots as possible from a power ammo pickup - at base you'll get 21 shots, 24 with either Extended Mag or a Backup Mag mod, and 29 with both. Smallbore pushes out your range and stability - this fires fairly slowly so you should be able to control the recoil direction. In your first trait column, Rapid Hit's stability boost can help with hitting your crits, or Demolitionist harvests grenade energy on kills while, with your always being at the bottom of the magazine, High-Impact Reserves will always be procced, and can drop the TTK to 0.5s (4c), or Wellspring gets you even more ability energy. The intrinsic frame bonus of increased accuracy while ADsed and the Tex Balanced Stock Origin Trait of increased handling and movement speed while hipfiring either work against each other or give you the best of both worlds, depending on your perspective.

The legendary Dead Man's Tale is an all new scout rifle aggressive archetype, with stats that fall somewhere between precision and high impacts and a less than competitive, if easy to hit TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 1 body shot. You can push out your range with your barrel and mag, as this is slow firing so you should hopefully be able to control the recoil, particularly if you add a Counterbalance mod. If you're able to resist reloading, Under Pressure or alternatively Rapid Hit add gunfeel boosts, and High-Impact Reserves can make the TTK easier to hit (1c, 2b up to 6 resilience) towards the bottom of the magazine.

A new Breech-loading grenade launcher doublefire archetype so there's not really any comparisons to be made. This can kill in one shot, if both projectiles hit, but that's unlikely so instead take advantage of the larger blast radius offered by two separate explosions instead, and spread the disorientating (formerly blinding) grenades over a wider area. Auto-Loading Holster will mean that as long as you have ammo available, you'll always be able to take a shot and Disruption Break applies a debuff that makes opponents to take 50% more damage from kinetic weapons for an easy blinting clean-up.

Aggressive Burst sidearms have a TTK of 0.73s with 4 crits and 1 body shot and a still competitive accuracy adjusted TTK of 0.83s (1c, 5b). The ranges on all sidearms are compressed, and the recoil direction is already pretty much vertical, so use the barrel and mag to boost handling and stability. For duelling, Tap the Trigger will improve accuracy and stability on every trigger pull. Rangefinder is the only way of really boosting the range, adding 1.5m when ADSed, giving you a little more breathing room.

// The Immortal (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, Rangefinder, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The base stats and perks are pretty stellar - Immortal has the highest range, stability and aim assist of any aggressive SMG. The out-of-the-box TTK is 0.75s for any resilience with 8 crits and 2 bodies, and the Accuracy Adjusted TTK is 0.83s (5c, 6b). You can push the range out all the way to 100 AND add Rangefinder on top of that with the right combination of perks and situation but, for the sake of control on a controller, you'll probably want to add a little stability into the mix or, at the very least, not penalise it. With that in mind, Smallbore is the top pick for the barrel perk, although Hammer-Forged Rifling and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives, with Ricochet Rounds the clear standout in the magazine. The roll that everyone's hot for is Rangefinder as the first trait column support perk and Target Lock as the signature perk in the second. Rangefinder's additional point of Zoom both pushes out your effective range and damage falloff, and constrains the recoil. Target Lock reduces the TTK down to 0.67s at 10 resilience (8c, 1b), and will melt anyone running 4 resilience or less on 0.53s with 8 crits, at the cost of having to commit to the engagement for the perk to proc - so no peek shooting! Alacrity is the best of the origin perks - when active it adds 20 range, 10 Aim Assist, 20 Stability and 50 Reload Speed.

You can push the range out all the way to 100 AND add Rangefinder on top of that with the right combination of perks and situation but, for the sake of control on a controller, you'll probably want to add a little stability into the mix or, at the very least, not penalise it. With that in mind, Smallbore is the top pick for the barrel perk, although Hammer-Forged Rifling and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives, with Ricochet Rounds the clear standout in the magazine. For a kill-chaining roll, Kill Clip as your second trait column signature perk reduces the TTK to 0.58s (7c, 1b) - even faster than Target Lock. Pairing with this, Rangefinder's additional point of Zoom both pushes out your effective range and damage falloff, and constrains the recoil, or Encore pairs well with extra range, stability and accuracy on kills. Alacrity is the best of the origin perks - when active it adds 10 range, 10 Aim Assist, 20 Stability and 20 Reload Speed. Recommended MW: Range, with an Adept Range mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Astral Horizon has decent stats by comparison with other kinetic slot aggressive shotguns, and an excellent PvP perk pool. Smoothbore, since S17 when the pellet spread was drastically reduced, is by far the best barrel perk for pushing out your range without any real downside.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Bite of the Fox is still as good in Season 20 as when the original arrived in Season 4. Lowest (except for Revoker) Zoom of 43 so you have as good a view when ADSed as you're likely to get. Handling is the normal play for the barrel perk, and this is no different, so FLuted Barrel would be the barrel perk of choice. The magazine perk doesn't make a huge different - Accurized Rounds maxes the range and pushes aim assist out a bit - not that you should really need it, or Flared Magwell adds to reload speed if you pick up a brick. for your support perk in the first trait column, your preferred sniping style would dictate either Snapshot Sights for more aggressive play or No Distractions for holding down a lane. In the second trait column as your signature perk, Opening Shot is the standout choice, improving range and accuracy. The Skulking Wolf is an occasionally helpful trait to proc if you've taken damage before winning your duel.

// The Hero's Burden (PvP first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Adaptive SMGs are in a bit of a tough spot, with the same TTK as Lightweights but needing all crits to kill in 0.73s (12 crits, 0 body shots), a slower Accuracy Adjusted TTK of 0.86s (8c, 6b)  and no bonus to Mobility or movement speed. There's no Rangefinder either, to help with range so you'll have to use your barrel and mag perks to try and be competitive. Full Bore in the barrel gives you as much range as possible - we can recover the penalties to stability and handling, with trait and origin perks - together with Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork results in 21.35m ADSed range. If you're going to try and hit all headshots, you'll need as much help as possible - both Zen Moment and Dynamic Sway Reduction as your trait perks may seem like overkill but, it's probably the only way to stand a chance. The Suros origin trait is one of the best for PvP, adding 36 handling and 20% flinch resistance after a reload.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 292 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/58kKJos3G7nO4MmMS0ScpA). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. The revised Wizened Rebuke was always A-Tier, if you learned to pre-charge, but with Season 20, and the new perk pool, it's now solidly S-Tier. With only five bolts fired, so less recoil to control, you can go all into range on M&KB - Full Bore and Projectile Fuse being the barrel and battery choices. Offhand Strike as the support perk in the first trait column is unbelievably good as at v7.0.0.6 when hipfiring after a kill - the additional range, stability and accuracy procced mean you'll be mapping people out to 25m or so for 7s (so make sure to pick up a few special bricks first!). To get the ball rolling for kill-chaining, Backup Plan as your second trait column signature perk makes no difference to the number of bolts needed to kill, which remains at four, and drops the charge time down to that of an adaptive frame's when procced.

Jorum's Claw, like other adaptive pulse rifles, has an abysmal TTK of 0.93s out of the box, with 6 crits and 1 body shot, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 1.00s (4c, 4b), but is very sensitive to even the smallest of damage buffs - Radiant, for example, drops the TTK down to 0.6s (6c). The stats are a bit of a mixed bag, with the low Zoom of 17 being useful for closer-range engagements at the cost of limiting the range and damage drop-off. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot tidies up the Recoil Direction, and adds a useful bump to Handling too, and Ricochet Rounds rounds out Range and Stability. For kill-chaining, Encore as the first trait column support perk provides more stability, handling and accuracy after a kill, to make hitting your crits easier, and Golden Tricorn as the second column signature perk drops the TTK to 0.6s (5c, 1b) at one stack. It's not impossible to proc the second stack, with this being a solar weapon, which drops the TTK further to 0.53s (3c, 2b).

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The out-of-the-box 1.0s TTK, with 2 crits and 1 body shot is definitely not competitive, so the trick is always to find a way to boost damage enough to two-tap in 0.5s. The Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait can be very handy - landing hits with 45% of a magazine within 7s of each other (so, 4 shots on Round Robin at base magazine size) will launch a mini rocket, with an energy type matching the weapon, doing 29 damage (14 impact, 15 explosive) on the next shot - these will also take any active damage buff. The fifth shot will launch the mini-rocket and, with 3x Surge mods, the sixth shot will then kill up to 9 resilience. There are a range of duelling traits that help boost range and accuracy, so we can look for a little balance in the barrel and mag, rather than go all in to range - Smallbore and Ricochet Rounds work well. For duelling, using Keep Away as the support perk in the first trait column and Opening Shot as the signature perk in the second will push range out to 98 (which is just shy of 40m) and add aim assist and accuracy bonuses with your first shot with both perks procced, and still keep 78 range (36.6m) and a smaller bump to accuracy for subsequent shots with Keep Away.

The Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait can be very handy - landing hits with 45% of a magazine within 7s of each other (so, 4 shots on Round Robin at base magazine size) will launch a mini rocket, with an energy type matching the weapon, doing 29 damage (14 impact, 15 explosive) on the next shot - these will also take any active damage buff. The fifth shot will launch the mini-rocket and, with 3x Surge mods, the sixth shot will then kill up to 9 resilience. There are a range of duelling traits that help boost range and accuracy, so we can look for a little balance in the barrel and mag, rather than go all in to range - Smallbore and Ricochet Rounds work well. For duelling, using Keep Away as the support perk in the first trait column pushes out range to 78 (36.6m) and a bump to accuracy when procced. Finally, as your second column signature perk, Elemental Capacitor paired with an arc (+50 Handling) or void (+20 Stability) subclass round out the stats to either make it snappier or for easier follow-up shots and reduced flinch. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

Shapeable. Rapid Frame Fusion Rifles have a TTK of 0.77s, with 7 bolts at any resilience. Overall decent stats, but with 1 less zoom than Cartesian Coordinate but good range to compensate. With enough range on a fusion rifle, you can rely more on Aim Assist than Stability - Full Bore, Projection Fuse, and a Range Masterwork will push the range out to 58, which is 17m ADS-ed, at the cost of 10 Stability and 5 Handling - just make sure you've got Targeting mods on your helmet too. In the first trait column as your support park, Well Rounded is easy to proc using Strand abilities - 1 stack recovers the Full Bore penalties and takes the range to 65 (ADS 17.52m), and at 2 stacks, you'll have 78 range (ADS 18.05m), 40 Stability and 67 Handling. The Enhanced version is even better adding 12 to Range, Stability and Handling per stack - at 2 stacks you'll push out range to 18.24m, which is more than Cartesian! Demolitionist as your second column signature perk, completes the loop by generating 20% grenade ability energy on a kill (22% for the Enhanced perk).

You need to hit with three shots to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often.Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Iterative Loop (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Projection Fuse, Under Pressure, Adrenaline Junkie
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling with a Light subclass. Shapeable. Rapid Frame Fusion Rifles have a TTK of 0.77s, with 7 bolts at any resilience. Overall decent stats, but with 1 less zoom than Cartesian Coordinate but good range to compensate. Using Arrowhead Brake and a Counterbalance mod takes the Recoil Direction to a far more controllable 92 and bumps up Handling to 62, while a combination of Projection Fuse and a Range Masterwork pushes range out to 16.2m while ADS-ed. In the first trait column as your support perk, Under Pressure should be procced constantly which will add 30 stability to make the recoil easier to control and add accuracy to the bolts, and then as your second column signature perk, Adrenaline Junkie x5 from a grenade kill will drop the TTK to 0.7s with six bolts and any additional damage boost (such as solar Radiant) drops the all-resilience TTK to 0.63s with only five bolts. You need to hit with three shots to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Rapid-fire shotguns have the lowest range of the shotgun archetype, so Basso Ostinato needs the right perks to compete. If you're lucky enough to drop one with Corkscrew or Smallbore and Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork, that gets you to 51 (5.27m range hipfire or ADS). But then if you add on Well Rounded as your first trait column support park, and proc both stacks, and then get Opening Shot as your second column signature perk as well, that pushes range out to 97 (6.59m) - aim for the neck and you should be good for a OHK in range, or a two-hit kill out to 8m or so.

If you're lucky enough to drop one with Corkscrew or Smallbore and Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork, that gets you to 51 (5.27m range hipfire or ADS). Perpetual Motion as your first trait column support park, is pretty easy to proc both stacks for 20 to handling, stability and reload speed, and then get Opening Shot as your second column signature perk as well, that pushes range out to 76 (6.00m) - aim for the neck and you should be good for a OHK in range, or a two-hit kill out to 7.5m or so.

// Volta Bracket (PvP first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. Average stats by comparison with other Aggressive sniper rifles and a tough-to-use 50 Zoom. But this can be very usable with the right perks. We can get range elsewhere, so you can use the barrel to boost handling with Fluted Barrel and a Handling Masterwork, and use the magazine to (unusually) boost reload speed as the most useful remaining stat - Alloy Mag is better with an empty mag or Flared Magwell if you still have one in the chamber. The combination of Enhanced Firmly Planted adding 35 Handling, 25 Stability, boosting recoil control, and improving accuracy and Enhanced Opening Shot as the second column signature perk layering on another 30 Range, 25 Aim Assist and more accuracy, brings you to totals of 100 Range, 53 Stability, 84 Handling and 68 Aim Assist. After landing two hits, the Nanotech Tracer Rocket origin trait should proc on the third shot (if you've picked up an ammo brick) - it won't make anyone body-shottable, but it's a bit of fun.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). Backup PvP pick for kill-chaining with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Average stats by comparison with other Aggressive sniper rifles and a tough-to-use 50 Zoom. But this can be very usable with the right perks. Fluted Barrel is the traditional barrel choice to bump handling, and Accurized Rounds does the same to range. In the first trat column as the support perk, Enhanced Firmly Planted adds 35 Handling, 25 Stability, boosts recoil control, and improves accuracy to make follow up shots easier. Hatchling as the second column signature perk spawns a Threadling on a crit kill - any opponent damaged by it up to 9 resilience can be body shot - if you run Thread of Evolution you'll be able to body shot any resilience. After landing two hits, the Nanotech Tracer Rocket origin trait should proc on the third shot (if you've picked up an ammo brick) - it won't make anyone body-shottable on its own, but it's a bit of fun.

// Dimensional Hypotrochoid (PvP first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, (Shot Swap, Unrelenting), One For All
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The first-ever Compressed Wave Frame power grenade launcher, so we have no real comparisons to make. Unfortunately it's not a great choice for PvP. To get a one-hit-kill you have to get a direct impact hit and the wave to strike too. If you do craft one for PvP, the blast radius stat has no real effect, so go all in to Velocity - Quick Launch and High-Velocity Rounds with a Velocity Masterwork push the stat to 63. There's thin pickings for your first trait column support perk - Shot Swap means at least means you have a fast stow speed after you're finished or, possibly, Unrelenting. Again, there's not much on offer in the second trait column for your signature perk - One For All when procced does mean that you can one-hit-kill with the wave alone, so maybe this is one to save for using on a control zone in 6s. You might occasionally see the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait proc, but that'll more be for fun than anything else. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. It's an adaptive frame LMG, so it's not the best choice for any Crucible activities. There's a base 0.53s TTK with 5 crits and 0 body shots and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.67s (2c, 4b). With that said, Smallbore adds a bit of extra range and stability, and then you want to get you mag as large as possible to pick up as many shots from a power ammo brick as you can. You're not going to be reloading, so Extended Mag and a Backup Mag are the way to go. For duelling, Keep Away in the first trait column as your support perk adds in some 10 range and accuracy when you're not in CQC. Eye of the Storm in the second as your signature perk layers on additional handling and accuracy while you're in a gunfight. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

If you're happy to hip-fire, for kill-chaining Offhand Strike as the first trait column support perk boosts range and accuracy after that first kill, while one stack of Golden Tricorn in the second column as your signature perk makes the TTK easier to get with 3 crits and 2 bodies, while two stacks reduces TTK to 0.4s (2c, 2b). Similarly, a Hatchling with Thread of Evolution on a Strand subclass will soften up an opponent for the same 0.4s TTK. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.
