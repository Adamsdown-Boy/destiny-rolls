@description:Season of Defiance Neomuna weapons with Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait

// Round Robin (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Ricochet Rounds, Keep Away, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The out-of-the-box 1.0s TTK, with 2 crits and 1 body shot is definitely not competitive, so the trick is always to find a way to boost damage enough to two-tap in 0.5s. The Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait can be very handy - landing hits with 45% of a magazine within 7s of each other (so, 4 shots on Round Robin at base magazine size) will launch a mini rocket, with an energy type matching the weapon, doing 29 damage (14 impact, 15 explosive) on the next shot - these will also take any active damage buff. The fifth shot will launch the mini-rocket and, with 3x Surge mods, the sixth shot will then kill up to 9 resilience. There are a range of duelling traits that help boost range and accuracy, so we can look for a little balance in the barrel and mag, rather than go all in to range - Smallbore and Ricochet Rounds work well. For duelling, using Keep Away as the support perk in the first trait column and Opening Shot as the signature perk in the second will push range out to 98 (which is just shy of 40m) and add aim assist and accuracy bonuses with your first shot with both perks procced, and still keep 78 range (36.6m) and a smaller bump to accuracy for subsequent shots with Keep Away. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

Harmony as your second trait column signature perk will both boost handling and two-tap (2c) up to 5 resilience, up to 8 with one Surge mod or any resilience with two - the damage boost will also apply to the mini-rocket. There are a few first trait column support perks that you can pair, but Under Pressure (if you're swapping between weapons you're more likely to be towards the bottom of the mag) is probably the most useful.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. Lowish stats by comparison with other High-Impacts, in particular Range and Stability, but that's what you'd expect from a world drop weapon. An out-of-the-box all-Resilience TTK of 0.67s with 6 crits is difficult to achieve, especially with only 31 Aim Assistance, without help from perks and helmet targetting mods. Push the range and stability up with Smallbore and Ricochet Rounds and a Range Masterwork to 80 (that's 39.46m ADS-ed) and 66 respectively, and take the Recoil Direction to 95 with a Counterbalance mod. Enhanced Keep Away as your first trait column support perk takes the Range to 90 (40.77mm ADS), and boosts accuracy and, while Headseeker as the second column signature perk doesn't reduce TTK at all, but the additional Aim Assist will make the 0.67s TTK with 5 crits and a body shot for resiliences of 8 or less easier to hit. It also means you'll two burst with one body and two crits at resiliences up to 7. You need to hit with four bursts to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait on the fifth so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Lowish stats by comparison with other precision SMGs, in particular Range, but that's what you'd expect from a world drop weapon. Precision SMGs have a 0.8s TTK with 6 crits and 2 body shots and a slowish Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.9s (5c, 5b). It should be fairly easy to control as a precision-frame SMG, so push out the range as far as you can with Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds, and a range Masterwork - all of those will get you to 78 which equates to 20.57m in-game. You could make an interesting kill-chaining swap weapon with Envious Assassin in the first trait column as your support perk and then Cascade Point in the second as your signature perk. Each kill adds 3 to the mag after you swap, and reduces TTK to a speedy 0.56s (7c, 2b). Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

You are never going to make an Immortal out of Synchronic Roulette, but the combination of Pulse Monitor in your first trait column as your support perk and Target Lock as your second column, signature perk will mean that, while you're out of cover firing at a target with Target Lock, which cuts TTK to 0.7s (7c, 1b), if you are taking damage from return fire you'll get a refilled magazine and a +50 boost to Handling.

// Iterative Loop (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Projection Fuse, Under Pressure, Kickstart
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. Rapid Frame Fusion Rifles have a TTK of 0.77s, with 7 bolts at any resilience. Overall decent stats, but with 1 less zoom than Cartesian Coordinate but good range to compensate. Using Arrowhead Brake and a Counterbalance mod takes the Recoil Direction to a far more controllable 92 and bumps up Handling to 62, while a combination of Projection Fuse and a Range Masterwork pushes range out to 16.2m while ADS-ed. In the first trait column as your support perk, Under Pressure should be procced constantly which will add 30 stability to make the recoil easier to control and add accuracy to the bolts, and then as your second column signature perk, Kickstart reduces the TTK to 0.63s by applying a 0.8 scalar to charge time. Any additional damage boost (such as Radiant) will drop to TTK to 0.6s with only six bolts needed to kill at 10 Resilience. You need to hit with three shots to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod.

Shapeable. Rapid Frame Fusion Rifles have a TTK of 0.77s, with 7 bolts at any resilience. Overall decent stats, but with 1 less zoom than Cartesian Coordinate but good range to compensate. Using Arrowhead Brake and a Counterbalance mod takes the Recoil Direction to a far more controllable 92 and bumps up Handling to 62, while a combination of Projection Fuse and a Range Masterwork pushes range out to 16.2m while ADS-ed. In the first trait column as your support perk, Under Pressure should be procced constantly which will add 30 stability to make the recoil easier to control and add accuracy to the bolts, and then as your second column signature perk, Enhanced Elemental Capacitor with a void subclass adds a further 25 Stability to make this a bit of a laser. You need to hit with three shots to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often.Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Rapid Frame Fusion Rifles have a TTK of 0.77s, with 7 bolts at any resilience. Overall decent stats, but with 1 less zoom than Cartesian Coordinate but good range to compensate. With enough range on a fusion rifle, you can rely more on Aim Assist than Stability - Full Bore, Projection Fuse, and a Range Masterwork will push the range out to 58, which is 17m ADS-ed, at the cost of 10 Stability and 5 Handling - just make sure you've got Targeting mods on your helmet too. In the first trait column as your support park, Well Rounded is easy to proc using Strand abilities - 1 stack recovers the Full Bore penalties and takes the range to 65 (ADS 17.52m), and at 2 stacks, you'll have 78 range (ADS 18.05m), 40 Stability and 67 Handling. The Enhanced version is even better adding 12 to Range, Stability and Handling per stack - at 2 stacks you'll push out range to 18.24m, which is more than Cartesian! Demolitionist as your second column signature perk, completes the loop by generating 20% grenade ability energy on a kill (22% for the Enhanced perk). You need to hit with three shots to proc the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait so, unfortunately you're unlikely to see it often.Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Rapid-fire shotguns have the lowest range of the shotgun archetype, so Basso Ostinato needs the right perks to compete. If you're lucky enough to drop one with Corkscrew or Smallbore and Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork, that gets you to 51 (5.27m range hipfire or ADS). But then if you add on Well Rounded as your first trait column support park, and proc both stacks, and then get Opening Shot as your second column signature perk as well, that pushes range out to 97 (6.59m) - aim for the neck and you should be good for a OHK in range, or a two-hit kill out to 8m or so.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. Average stats by comparison with other Aggressive sniper rifles and a tough-to-use 50 Zoom. But this can be very usable with the right perks. We can get range elsewhere, so you can use the barrel to boost handling with Fluted Barrel and a Handling Masterwork, and use the magazine to (unusually) boost reload speed as the most useful remaining stat - Alloy Mag is better with an empty mag or Flared Magwell if you still have one in the chamber. The combination of Enhanced Firmly Planted adding 35 Handling, 25 Stability, boosting recoil control, and improving accuracy and Enhanced Opening Shot as the second column signature perk layering on another 30 Range, 25 Aim Assist and more accuracy, brings you to totals of 100 Range, 53 Stability, 84 Handling and 68 Aim Assist. After landing two hits, the Nanotech Tracer Rocket origin trait should proc on the third shot (if you've picked up an ammo brick) - it won't make anyone body-shottable, but it's a bit of fun.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). Backup PvP pick for kill-chaining with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Average stats by comparison with other Aggressive sniper rifles and a tough-to-use 50 Zoom. But this can be very usable with the right perks. Fluted Barrel is the traditional barrel choice to bump handling, and Accurized Rounds does the same to range. In the first trat column as the support perk, Enhanced Firmly Planted adds 35 Handling, 25 Stability, boosts recoil control, and improves accuracy to make follow up shots easier. Hatchling as the second column signature perk spawns a Threadling on a crit kill - any opponent damaged by it up to 9 resilience can be body shot - if you run Thread of Evolution you'll be able to body shot any resilience.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The first-ever Compressed Wave Frame power grenade launcher, so we have no real comparisons to make. Unfortunately it's not a great choice for PvP. To get a one-hit-kill you have to get a direct impact hit and the wave to strike too. If you do craft one for PvP, the blast radius stat has no real effect, so go all in to Velocity - Quick Launch and High-Velocity Rounds with a Velocity Masterwork push the stat to 63. There's thin pickings for your first trait column support perk - Shot Swap means at least means you have a fast stow speed after you're finished or, possibly, Unrelenting. Again, there's not much on offer in the second trait column for your signature perk - One For All when procced does mean that you can one-hit-kill with the wave alone, so maybe this is one to save for using on a control zone in 6s. You might occasionally see the Nanotech Tracer Rockets origin trait proc, but that'll more be for fun than anything else. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 295 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5R8QyPNo18IjGX4iukcE3k). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. It's an adaptive frame LMG, so it's not the best choice for any Crucible activities. There's a base 0.53s TTK with 5 crits and 0 body shots and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.67s (2c, 4b). With that said, Smallbore adds a bit of extra range and stability, and then you want to get you mag as large as possible to pick up as many shots from a power ammo brick as you can. You're not going to be reloading, so Extended Mag and a Backup Mag are the way to go. For duelling, Keep Away in the first trait column as your support perk adds in some 10 range and accuracy when you're not in CQC. Eye of the Storm in the second as your signature perk layers on additional handling and accuracy while you're in a gunfight. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.
