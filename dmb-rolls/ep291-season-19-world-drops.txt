// Lodbrok-C (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Cascade Point
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. (???  ???): First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait's +30% damage to constructs can be very useful with Titan barricades around. High Impact Auto Rifles have an out of the box TTK of 0.83s (6 crits 0 bodies) and accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (4c, 3b) as at v6.3.0.7. Decent stats across the board by comparison with its competitors. Arrowhead Brake tidies up the recoil direction and adds extra Handling, While Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability. Then, if you use Dynamic Sway Reduction to help with hitting your crits (or get a kill with another weapon), Cascade Point's increased fire rate reduces the TTK to 0.5s (6c) for 2.5s. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Prolonged Engagement (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Extended Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling0, High-Caliber Rifling, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. (???  ???): First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. As a Season 19 Vanguard weapon, you need to have as many resets as possible to stand a reasonable chance of a decent roll. The Veist Stinger Origin Trait can be useful in combat to keep the mag topped up passively. Lightweight SMGs have a base TTK of 0.73s (10 crits, 2 bodies) and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.8s (9c, 4b), as well of the boost to mobility. With a zoom of only 14, and an in-band set of stats, you'll never compete for range, so you might as well capitalise on what makes this SMG different. Increase your range, recoil direction and/or handling with your barrel park, and capitalise on the 900 RPM with High-Caliber Rounds to add flinch. Dynamic Sway Reduction adds stability and accuracy boosts to keep your reticule on target, and Target Lock can drop the TTK by shaving off a bullet. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip or mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

Lean into the hipfire lifestyle with Offhand Strike, to add stability and huge accuracy buffs, and a Freehand Grip mod, and combine that with Multikill Clip which, with one stack drops your TTK down to 0.6s (9c 1b) and AATTK to 0.73 (6c, 6b).

// Fioritura-59 (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, (Zen Moment, Killing Wind), Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. (???  ???): First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. Suros Synergy is one of the most useful PvP perks, boosting handling and reducing flinch after a reload. Rapid-fire sidearms have a competitive out-of-the-box TTK of 0.6s (6c, 1b) and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.8s (3c, 4b) within their range. In-band stats, but with a standout Airborne Effectiveness of 23. Sidearm ranges are highly compressed, so boost stability with your barrel and mag instead to make crits easier. In the first trait column, Zen Moment can help keep your reticule on target or Killing Wind adds handling and mobility after a kill. In the second column, Kill Clip is tempting - reducing TTK to 0.53s (4c, 1b) for 5s when reloading after a kill, but Golden Tricorn x1 is the same TTK (albeit with 5c), and is easier to proc, as it doesn't need a reload. Throw on a Surprise Attack mod, and Mechaneers Tricksleeves for a Hunter and in the right circumstances you can get down to a 0.27s TTK with three crits. Recommended MW: Stability, with an Icarus Grip, if you're leaning into an aerial playstyle, or Targeting Adjuster, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.
