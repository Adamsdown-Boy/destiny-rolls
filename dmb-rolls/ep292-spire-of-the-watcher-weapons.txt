@description:Spire of the Watcher dungeon weapons with Rasputin's Arsenal origin perk

// Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, (Seraph Rounds, Extended Mag), Air Assault, Perfect Float
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Precision Hand Cannons have an uncompetitive, but easy 1.0 TTK with 2 crits and 2 bodies against any resilience - but they really need their stats and perks to line up to be competitive as at v7.0.0.3. Unfortunately, the stats for the Officer Revolver aren't great - really the only thing it has that's different is the Rasputin's Arsenal origin perk which refunds 50% of your magazine when you break a shield, and the option to use Seraph Rounds. Start off with Smallbore to push out range and stability, and then build into an what makes this unique - Seraph Rounds for all of the benefits of High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing and Ricochet Rounds or maximise your Airborne Effectiveness with Extended Mag, and let the origin trait keep your mag topped up. To keep doubling down into an aerial playstyle, Air Assault, Perfect Float and an Icarus Grip mod mean you can hit 83 AE, which should give you enough of an edge in the air. Recommended MW: Range, with an Icarus Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Seventh Seraph Carbine (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Seraph Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Precision auto rifles have a reasonable 0.8s TTK with 6 crits and a body, and a 0.93s Accuracy Adjusted TTK (4c, 4b) against any resilience. The stats aren't great - dragging along the bottom of its peers but even so it feels okay to use. Add in a little range and stability with Smallbore, and Seraph Rounds in the mag for all of the benefits of High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing and Ricochet Rounds. Dynamic Sway Reduction overcomes much of the gunfeel shortcomings and, in the last column Target Lock can reduce the TTK down to 0.67s up to 9 resilience, and with the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait refunding 50% of your magazine on a shield break, you should be able to move between encounters after a kill with a nicely topped-up magazine. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. Backup PvP pick for duelling.

Dynamic Sway Reduction overcomes much of the gunfeel shortcomings and, in the last column Moving Target, Rangefinder or Elemental Capacitor (Arc for Handling or Void for Stability) each provide a useful passive bump to stats. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait can be really useful refunding 50% of your magazine on a shield break, so you should be able to move between encounters after a kill with a nicely topped-up magazine.

// Terminus Horizon (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Extended Mag, (Rapid Hit, Demolitionist), (High-Impact Reserves, Wellspring)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. High Impact LMGs will kill any resilience in 0.67s with and easy 3 crits and 2 body shots - unfortunately, that's the same TTK as some competitive primaries and slower than most special weapons, so LMGs are in a tough place in PvP. If you do run one, you need to maximise the mag size to make sure you're getting as many shots as possible from a power ammo pickup - at base you'll get  21 shots, 24 with either Extended Mag or a Backup Mag mod, and 29 with both. Smallbore pushes out your range and stability - this fires fairly slowly so you should be able to control the recoil direction. In your first trait column, Rapid Hit's stability boost can help with hitting your crits, or Demolitionist harvests grenade energy on kills while, with your always being at the bottom of the magazine, High-Impact Reserves will always be procced, and can drop the TTK to 0.5s (4c), or Wellspring gets you even more ability energy. The intrinsic frame bonus of increased accuracy while ADsed and the Tex Balanced Stock Origin Trait of increased handling and movement speed while hipfiring either work against each other or give you the best of both worlds, depending on your perspective. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Long Arm (PvP first-choice roll)
// Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, (Under Pressure, Rapid Hit), High-Impact Reserves
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The legendary Dead Man's Tale is an all new scout rifle aggressive archetype, with stats that fall somewhere between precision and high impacts and a less than competitive, if easy to hit TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 1 body shot. You can push out your range with your barrel and mag, as this is slow firing so you should hopefully be able to control the recoil, particularly if you add a Counterbalance mod. If you're able to resist reloading, Under Pressure or alternatively Rapid Hit add gunfeel boosts, and High-Impact Reserves can make the TTK easier to hit (1c, 2b up to 6 resilience) towards the bottom of the magazine. As a bonus, the Tex Balanced Stock Origin Trait of increased handling and movement speed while hipfiring won't take you all the way to DMT but will give you a slightly easier time if you want to try. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The legendary Dead Man's Tale is an all new scout rifle aggressive archetype, with stats that fall somewhere between precision and high impacts and a less than competitive, if easy to hit TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 1 body shot. You don't really need any more range with a scout rifle, so you can invest into other gunfeel stats with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit layers on stability and reload speed, and the combination of Explosive Payload and 100 impact should result in real flinch problems for opponents while you keep hitting your crits. As a bonus, the Tex Balanced Stock Origin Trait of increased handling and movement speed while hipfiring won't take you all the way to DMT but will give you a slightly easier time if you want to try.

If you're looking to really focus in on DMT's hipfire, then the combination of Hipfire Grip and a Freehand Grip mod will give you extra aim assistance, accuracy and stability, and then add this to the Tex Balanced Stock Origin Trait offering increased handling and movement speed to get there.

// Wilderflight (PvP first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, Blinding Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, Disruption Break
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. A new Breech-loading grenade launcher doublefire archetype so there's not really any comparisons to be made. This can kill in one shot, if both projectiles hit, but that's unlikely so instead take advantage of the larger blast radius offered by two separate explosions instead, and spread the disorientating (formerly blinding) grenades over a wider area. Auto-Loading Holster will mean that as long as you have ammo available, you'll always be able to take a shot and Disruption Break applies a debuff that makes opponents to take 50% more damage from kinetic weapons for an easy blinting clean-up.

// Liminal Vigil (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, Tap the Trigger, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 291 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Aggressive Burst sidearms have a TTK of 0.73s with 4 crits and 1 body shot and a still competitive accuracy adjusted TTK of 0.83s (1c, 5b). The ranges on all sidearms are compressed, and the recoil direction is already pretty much vertical, so use the barrel and mag to boost handling and stability. For duelling, Tap the Trigger will improve accuracy and stability on every trigger pull. Rangefinder is the only way of really boosting the range, adding 1.5m when ADSed, giving you a little more breathing room.

The ranges on all sidearms are compressed, and the recoil direction is already pretty much vertical, so use the barrel and mag to boost handling and stability. For kill-chaining - so primarily for 6s PvP modes - Desperado reduces TTK to 0.57s for 6s after a crit kill or Kill Clip reduces to 0.47s (2c, 2b) for 5s after any kill. As you'll need to reload for the damage boost, Tunnel Vision is the obvious partner, to boost both accuracy and aim assist at the same time.
