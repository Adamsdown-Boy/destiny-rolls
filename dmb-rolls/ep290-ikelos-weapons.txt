@description:Season 19's (Season of the Seraph) reprised IKELOS weapons with the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait

// IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore), Accurized Rounds, Subsistence, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 290 with @illPhysics and @Legoleflash (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6zujbQ3jq1QXNWXAljFS2U?si=5d5e2e8d00974c49). . First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Precision hand cannons have an uncompetitive, if easy to achieve TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 2 bodies. Pretty poor stats across the board - even maxing range will not make this play well, but if you're going to use it, that's the play with your barrel, mag and masterwork. If you are able to resist reloading though, with the high fire rate and aim assistance, you could use Focused Fury as your second trait column perk - five crits reduces your TTK to 0.67s (3c) - pair that with Subsistence in the first trait column, and you should be able to keep three tapping for the whole 11s. Otherwise, Frenzy or one stack of Golden Tricorn will do the same, but are a little more difficult use - Frenzy is easy to lose the buff if you go in to cover to recover, and Golden Tricorn x1 lasts for 7s. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvP pick for in-air duelling. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful.

You can make this a contender for aerial use with Extended Mag and Air Assault, and proccing Golden Tricorn, Frenzy or Focused Fury, will reduce the TTK to 0.67 (3c).

First-choice PvP pick for Hunter Gyrfalcon in-air duelling. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Precision hand cannons have an uncompetitive, if easy to achieve TTK of 1.0s with 2 crits and 2 bodies. Pretty poor stats across the board - even maxing range will not make this play well, but if you're going to use it, that's the play with your barrel and masterwork. You can make this a contender for aerial use with Extended Mag and Air Assault and, for Gyrfalcon users, you can get yourself a void overshield after every kill by using Repulsor Brace.

Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Rapid-fire shotguns suffer from having the same two shots as other shotguns, but a worse effective range, limiting their utility. Decent stats which means you can improve the range by 1.2m with the right perks - Smoothbore is the barrel of choice as at v6.3.0.5, with the pellet spread changes, but Corkscrew Rifling is a decent alternative, with Accurized Rounds in the mag and a range masterwork. Use this with a melee build, and Pugilist (returning 20% melee energy on a kill) with Swashbuckler (which extends the useful range when procced) is a natural pairing, but Grave Robber or Subsistence can also work well, depending on whether you're finishing or leading with your melee.

First-choice PvP pick for duelling with an Arc subclass. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait is more useful with a kill-chaining than a duelling roll, but topping up your magazine after a shield break is always useful. Rapid-fire sniper rifles are in a difficult place for PvP - they don't do enough body shot damage for blinting and they won't always OHK a super. This has decent stats, but to be usable you'll need extra range - Full Bore, Accurized Rounds and a range masterwork together with Fragile Focus can get your range to 85 for a stickier reticule at range, and then Elemental Capacitor with an arc subclass brings Handling to 100 for snappiness.

Rapid-fire sniper rifles are in a difficult place for PvP - they don't do enough body shot damage for blinting and they won't always OHK a super. This has decent stats, but like all sniper rifles you'll want a combination of range and handling. Fluted Barrel, Accurized Rounds and a range masterwork are a good base. The in your traits, Surplus can get your handling to 100 with three stacks, Perpetual Motion gets it to 97 with two stacks, Moving Target improves your Aim Assistance or, if you're planning to lock down a lane, No Distractions reduces your flinch and then Box Breathing boosts your range (and crit damage, which improves effective range) for the cost of 1.5s of ADS.
