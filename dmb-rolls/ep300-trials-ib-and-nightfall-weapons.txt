@description:Season of the Deep selected new and returning Trials, Iron Banner and Nightfall weapons

// The Messenger (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Ricochet Rounds, (Moving Target, Rapid Hit), Headseeker
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 300 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iMcFXv9Z5s6UdfNWtufZ1?si=e7cb3b990bca4866). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. You'll need to enjoy the slower ROF of high-impact frames, and the out-of-the-box TTK of 0.67s is competitive, but requires 6 crits with no body shots, so is very onforgiving, and the Accuracy Adjusted TTK of 1.07s (4c, 3b) shows how punishing starting that third burst is. To stand the best chance of hitting those crits with Messenger, you'll need to sort out the wonky recoil directions with Arrowhead Brake, and boost the stability with Ricochet Rounds and a Stability masterwork. Then, in the first trait column as the support perk, Moving Target adds Aim Assist or Rapid Hit boosts stability. Finally, the damage boost from Headseeker in the second column as the signature perk is your secret sauce, letting you hit 5 crits and a body, giving you a little forgiveness, and also makes hitting crits easier after a body shot with a bump to Aim Assist. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Targeting Adjuster mod or, if you want perfect up-and-down recoil, a Counterbalance mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

To stand the best chance of hitting those crits with Messenger, you'll need to sort out the wonky recoil directions with Arrowhead Brake, and boost the stability with Ricochet Rounds and a Stability masterwork. Working back from Kill Clip in the second trait column as the signature perk, which drops the TTK to 0.6s (4c, 1b) the tried-and-true first column support perks of Rapid Hit or Outlaw both work to boost reload after the first kill (and also boost Stability for Rapid Hit), or Moving Target boosts Aim Assist to make hitting crits easier.

// Unexpected Resurgence (PvP first-choice roll)
// Supercooled Accelerator, Accurized Rounds, Impulse Amplifier, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 300 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iMcFXv9Z5s6UdfNWtufZ1?si=e7cb3b990bca4866). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Unexpected Resurgence is an adaptive glaive coming into a slightly crowded field, but it has better stats than all its peers, which means you can get close to 100 range to max out projectile speed. The vanilla TTK is 0.9s with two shots. Resist the urge to melee - the key to PvP use is the shield - with all this in mind, Supercooled Accelerator adds 10 to Range without hurting the shield duration, and Accurized Rounds together with a Range Masterwork, gets you up to 90 (and if you're in Rumble, Alacrity will push you over the top!). Impulse Amplifier is the must-have support perk from the first trait column for the 35% projectile speed boost, and also some valuable extra reload speed. No damage boosting option from the second column as the signature perk will let you OHK on its own, but if the stars align and you can get both Surrounded and Radiant procced, you'll one-shot at any resilience in CQC. As the cherry on top, being an arc special weaspon, you can also build into Jolt and Blinding verbs on a matching subclass. Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip mod.

// Mercurial Overreach (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, (Snapshot Sights, Surplus), Opening Shot, Short-Action Stock
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 300 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iMcFXv9Z5s6UdfNWtufZ1?si=e7cb3b990bca4866). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Mercurial Overrach has jacked stats - the highest range and handling of any adaptive  sniper rifle with the lowest zoom scope of 40 and an extra perk in the form of a stock to choose from. Just mnake it a better version of itself by using Fluted Barrel in the barrel and Ricochet Rounds in the mag to bump the gunfeel stats. As the first trait, for the support perk, Snapshot Sights is still useful even after the nerf on special weapons or if you're running a Strand subclass, with the extra ability charges, Surplus could be a serious option, boosting stability to 95, and handling and reload speed to 100. Opening Shot's boost to range, aim assist and accuracy as the second trait signature perk is pretty much a no-brainer for snipers. Finally, Short-Action Stock adds even more handling with no downsides. Recommended MW: Range, with a Quick Access Sling or Targeting Adjuster mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Loaded Question (PvP first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 300 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iMcFXv9Z5s6UdfNWtufZ1?si=e7cb3b990bca4866).  First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Loaded Questions perk set is more PvE orientated, and you will need to adapt to the charge time in play, but it's still able to drop with a decent PvP roll, if you don't already have a good Glacioclasm. It's going to take 4 out of 5 bolts to kill reliably in 1.09s, although it will 3-bolt up to 8 resilience in 1.06s. Pushing out the range and improving the recoil direction a little with Extended Barrel and a range masterwork should make it easier to control. Accelerated Coils drops the charge time (and the TTK) by 40ms and doesn't affect the number of bolts to kill. Under Pressure as the first trait support perk makes the bolts at the bottom of the mag (which is where you'll be most of the time) easier to land. You'll likely be taking some damage while charging, so the second trait signature perk, Eye of the Storm layers additional handling and accuracy on top. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjuster mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

Loaded Questions perk set is more PvE orientated, and you will need to adapt to the charge time in play, but it's still able to drop with a decent PvP roll, if you don't already have a good Glacioclasm. At base, it's going to take 4 out of 5 bolts to kill reliably in 1.09s, although it will 3-bolt up to 8 resilience in 1.06s. Pushing out the range and improving the recoil direction a little with Extended Barrel and a Range masterwork should make it easier to control. For the adept version, Ionised Battery reduces the number of bolts to kill at any resilience to 3 - not so much for the slightly improved TTK, but more for the forgiveness of a bolt missing, and you can recover the penalty to charge time with an Adapt Charge Time mod, which is one of the few ways of improving the stat without suffering a reduction in damage. Under Pressure as the first trait support perk makes the bolts at the bottom of the mag (which is where you'll be most of the time) easier to land. You'll likely be taking some damage while charging, so the second trait signature perk, Eye of the Storm layers additional handling and accuracy on top.
