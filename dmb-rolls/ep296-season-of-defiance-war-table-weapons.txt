@description:Season of Defiance Queensguard craftable weapons with Noble Deeds origin trait, and Imperial Decree

// Perpetualis (PvP first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Accurized Rounds, (Elemental Capacitor, Zen Moment), Eye of the Storm
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice. Perpetualis has mostly in-bands stats except for lowish stability and a lowest in subfamily recoil direction of 53, but decent Aim Assistance. A base TTK of 0.8s with 9 crits and no body shots at any resilience is reasonable, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK 0.9s (7c, 3b) is easy to achieve. Arrowhead Brake is really the only sensible choice in the barrel, to improve recoil direction, with Accurized Rounds to improve range in the magazine. For a duelling roll, Elemental Capacitor on void will sort out the stability or stasis to help recoil direction, or Zen Moment will bring the recoil under control in the first trait column as your support perk. In the second, as your signature perk, Eye of the Storm makes headshots easier to hit and boosts handling just for being in a gunfight. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance or Targeting Adjustor mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Perpetualis (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Accurized Rounds, Killing Wind, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, and Strand synergy. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice. Perpetualis has mostly in-bands stats except for lowish stability and a lowest in subfamily recoil direction of 53, but decent Aim Assistance. A base TTK of 0.8s with 9 crits and no body shots at any resilience is reasonable, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK 0.9s (7c, 3b) is easy to achieve. Arrowhead Brake is really the only sensible choice in the barrel, to improve recoil direction, with Accurized Rounds to improve range in the magazine. For a kill-chaining roll, Killing Wind as the first trait column support perk, adds mobility, handling and accuracy perks on a kill, and makes the one stack of Golden Tricorn in the second column as your signature perk, which reduces TTK to 0.7s (7c, 1b) easier to hit. If you can proc the second stack with a Strand ability, the TTK drops to a lightning fast 0.5s (6c 0b). Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance or Targeting Adjustor mod.

Arrowhead Brake is really the only sensible choice in the barrel, to improve recoil direction, with Accurized Rounds to improve range in the magazine. In the first trait column as your support perk or kill chaining, a combination of Envious Assassin, to overfill the magazine or Elemental Capacitor on an Arc subclass to turbocharge handling, and Cascade Point in the second for your second column signature perk reduces the base TTK to 0.48s for 2.5s after swapping to this following a kill with another weapon.

// Raconteur (PvP first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Rapid Hit, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice. Out of the box, all precision bows have a two body, no crit 1.33s TTK. Raconteur's stats are a mixed bag - the lowest Accuracy, but the highest Handling and Airborne Effectiveness. As with all bows, we're looking to reduce Draw Time with the bowstring - Elastic String has the biggest reduction, and a Draw Time Masterwork, and then recover the lost Accuracy with the Arrow - Fiberglass Arrow Shaft more than does this. We can choose both the S-Tier Enhanced Archer's Tempo in the first trait column as the support perk, and Enhanced Successful Warm-Up in the second column as the signature perk. Because they apply multipliers, you can get below the 0.54s floor for Precision bow draw times, down to an incredible 0.27s draw time, reducing your 2 body TTK to 0.95s. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Targeting Adjustor or Quick Access Sling mod or, if you're building into an aerial playstyle, an Icarus Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Raconteur (PvP first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, (Rapid Hit, Surplus), Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for duelling and Stasis synergy. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice.

As with all bows, we're looking to reduce Draw Time with the bowstring - Elastic String has the biggest reduction, and a Draw Time Masterwork, and then recover the lost Accuracy with the Arrow - Fiberglass Arrow Shaft more than does this. Either Rapid Hit or Surplus in the first trait column as your support perk will reduce your loading/draw time - Surplus x2 is about the same as Rapid Hit, and doesn't need proccing with a headshot. As your second column, signature trait, Headstone works with the Stasis toolkit, prevents revives and can generate AoE damage if shattered.

If you're playing aggessively, using Shot Swap in the first trait column as you signature perk will let you build up charges for lightning fast swaps to your energy or special weapon for CQC. As your second column, signature trait, Headstone works with the Stasis toolkit, prevents revives and can generate AoE damage if shattered.

// Royal Executioner (PvP first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Projection Fuse, Offhand Strike, Killing Wind
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). (???  ???): First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice. Unfortunately, the stats just aren't quite as good as other adaptive fusion rifles at base - you do need 6 out of 7 bolts to kill reliably, with a TTK of 0.86s. As there's no Under Pressure or High-Impact Reserves, so lean into the meme machine build. Start off by cleaning up the Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel and a Counterbalance mod, to clean up the Recoil Direction and Projection Fuse in the Battery and a Range Masterwork to push out range. In the first trait column, as your support perk, Offhand Strike pushes out hip-fire shots to a ridiculous range, and Killing Wind in the second column as your signature perk doubles down, so  you'll be able to kill with six bolts out to 30.5m from the hip after your first kill. Recommended MW: Range, with a Counterbalance mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Prodigal Return (PvP first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, (Disorienting Grenades, Proximity Grenades), Envious Assassin, Disruption Break
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and reload speed is nice. As at Season 20, tis is our first shapeable lightweight energy grenade launcher. The stats are in-band, so the usual play is to use the barrel to improve velocity - Quick Launch is the best for this. In the magazine, you have a choice - Disorienting Grenades reduce the blast radius to 0, but will still one-hit-kill on impact and will blind opponents around the detonation, or Proximity Grenades give you a bit more latitude with your aiming, but won't OHK as you'll lose impact damage. In the first trait column, as your support park, the new to Season 20 Envious Assassin will give you two in the chamber after a kill with another weapon, and in the second column as your signature perk, Disruption Break makes blinting with a kinetic primary easy, by increasing kinetic damage by 50%, so you only have to breathe on them (kinetically) for a kill. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Regnant (PvP first-choice roll)
// Linear Compensator, High-Explosive Ordnance, Shot Swap, Destabilising Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for kill chaining. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling is nice. Regnant has more PvE than PvP perks, but if you're tempted to make your own, Linear Compensator in the Barrel and High Explosive Ordnance in the mag, with a Blast Radius Masterwork increase blast radius to 75 and velocity to 38. There's nothing really that helpful in the first trait column to use as your support perk, so Shot Swap is your Hobson's choice for a fast swap back when you're done and Destabilising Rounds at least makes for an easy clean-up for any opponents caught in the blast who are still standing.

// Caretaker (PvP first-choice roll)
// Jagged Edge, (Burst Guard, Heavy Guard), Energy Transfer, Valiant Charge
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for highly mobile duelling. Shapeable. The Noble Deeds origin trait is a bit difficult to feel when procced, but even a little extra handling and faster charge rate is nice. If you really insist on using a sword in your power slot, why not build into the new Valiant Charge perk in the second trait, signature perk column with Jagged Edge in the blade, Heavy Guard or Burst Guard as your guard - you'll need to guard and tank a bit of damage. As you'll being doing that, Energy Transfer as your first column support trait will mean you'll gain some extra class ability energy, and then you can close the gap to your opponent with Valiant Charge for a speedy kill. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Quick Access Sling mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

// Imperial Decree (PvP first-choice roll)
// Full Choke, Accurized Rounds, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for aggressive duelling. Shapeable. The To Excess origin trait can work well in PvP for a grenade and melee energy regeneration boost after a kill. This is the Astral Horizon we've got at home for those who don't want to dip their toes into Trials. There's no Adept mods, but we do have Enhanced Perks instead, so it's a close contest between the two overall. As there's no option for Elemental Capacity, it is going to feel heavier, so go all into range and consistency - Full Choke in the barrel keeps the pellet spread tighter, and then the combination of Accurized Rounds and a Range Masterwork together with Slideshot in the first trait column as your support perk and Opening Shot in the second as your signature perk will get your range out to 94 which will kill at any resilience out to 7m with 10 out of 12 pellets. Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 296 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/23ibFKKShmXHAuphKQLgXz). First-choice PvP pick for holdout weapon duelling. Shapeable. The To Excess origin trait can work well in PvP for a grenade and melee energy regeneration boost after a kill. This is the Astral Horizon we've got at home for those who don't want to dip their toes into Trials. There's no Adept mods, but we do have Enhanced Perks instead, so it's a close contest between the two overall. As there's no option for Elemental Capacitor, Imperial Decree is going to feel heavier without additional help from perks, so go all into range and consistency with barrel and mag - Full Choke keeps the pellet spread tighter, and then the combination of Accurized Rounds, a Range Masterwork and Opening Shot as the second trait column signature perk gets the range to 74 - you'll be lethal out to around 6.5m with 10 out of 12 pellets. To use as a holdout weapon, Threat Detector as the support perk in the first trait column boosts Handling to 58 with one stack or 100 with two, for snappy ready, ADS and stow speed. Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller
