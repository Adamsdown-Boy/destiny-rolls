@title:S-Tier Hand Cannons and rolls recommended by @illPhysics
@description:PvP hand cannon picks as at S17 from the discussion between Kyt and illPhysics

// Dire Promise (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Steadyhand HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Hitmark HCS), Ricochet Rounds, Snapshot Sights, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Originally a 150 Lightweight subtype that was rolled into the 140 Adaptive subtype, and suffers a little from being the only 13 Zoom HC in the sandbox. Stats make it very consistent feel - aim for stability and handling, to improve gunfeel, rather than range in barrel and mag. Snapshot Sights still (at S17) gets you into ADS in an engagement faster, and Rangefinder improves both your damage and aim assist dropoffs. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Targeting Adjuster mod if you're more passive, Sprint Grip/Quick Access Sling mod if you're more aggressive, or even give Rader Tuner mod a spin.

Originally a 150 Lightweight subtype that was rolled into the 140 Adaptive subtype, and suffers a little from being the only 13 Zoom HC in the sandbox. Stats make it very consistent feel - aim for stability and handling, to improve gunfeel, rather than solely range in barrel and mag.

// Crisis Inverted (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, Rapid Hit, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Big perk pool, so reset your Crucible rank a few times to give additional options in the first and second trait slots, to improve your odds. Pretty average stats except for a very good Recoil Direction, and Airborne Effectiveness - this is probably your best legendary in-air option as of S17. Rapid Hit crit hits will play well with the Omolon origin trail, to add stability as the magazine empties, and Rangefinder improves both your damage and aim assist dropoffs. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Icarus Grip mod to boost AE to over 30. Tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-duel

// Eyasluna (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fastdraw HCS, Ricochet Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Harmony
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for aggressive duelling. Arguably the one of the best PvP hand-cannons as at S17, if you're not mainly in the air, anyway - almost feels like you have an additional perk boost in the base stats, and has the highest base stability of any legendary HC. Boost Handling and Stability with our sight and mag. Perpetual Motion boosts those stats even further, just by moving around, and pair this with a Harmony Shotgun, like Matador 64, for your highly aggressive playstyle swapping between primary and special, each boosting the other's damage after kills. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Sprint Grip/Quick Access Sling mod. Tags: pvp, pvp-god, pvp-duel

// Fluted Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, Snapshot Sights, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Shapeable.

// (Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, Snapshot Sights, Rangefinder
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP backup S-Tier roll for duelling. Shapeable. Mid-range stats, but you can roll your own top-tier adaptive hand-cannon, rather than rely on RNG. Round out Handling, Stability and Range with your barrel and mag. Snapshot Sights still (at S17) gets you into ADS in an engagement faster, and Rangefinder improves both your damage and aim assist dropoffs. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Targeting Adjuster mod if you're more passive, Sprint Grip/Quick Access Sling mod if you're more aggressive, or even give Rader Tuner mod a spin. Tags: pvp, pvp-duel
