// Randy's Throwing Knife (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Arrowhead Brake), Ricochet Rounds, Zen Moment, Box Breathing
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 298 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0DVRUKwBeWHMYkkHHHKa3K?si=c339236f5b3444e6). First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Rapid-fire scouts have a TTK of 0.93s with 4 crits and one body shot, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 1.17s (2c, 4b). Stats are low, but it's s small field, particularly if you're just looking at kinetic slot options. There are 12 options in the two trait columns so, if you're looking for a good roll it's worth spending time resetting your reputation to get extra perk options - five resets give you the best chance of up to three options in each trait column, but three resets gives you a chance at two per column. You'll need to control the recoil - Smallbore and a Counterbalance mod adds stability (and range) and takes the recoil direction to 74, or Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod take it all the way to 100. Ricochet Rounds add more stability (and a bit more range too - which never hurts), ideally together with a Stability Masterwork. For a duelling roll, Zen Moment makes landing crits increasingly easier after the first hit, and Box Breathing's passive boost to the initial crit reduces the TTK to 0.7s (4c, 0b). Recommended MW: Stability, with a Counterbalance mod or, if you're able to handle the recoil direction, a Targeting Adjustor mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

Rapid-fire scouts have a TTK of 0.93s with 4 crits and one body shot, and an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 1.17s (2c, 4b).

Ricochet Rounds add more stability (and a bit more range too - which never hurts), ideally together with a Stability Masterwork. For kill-chaining, the tried and true combination of Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion as your first column support perk, and Kill Clip as the second column signature perk reduce the TTK to 0.7s (3c, 1b) and speed up your reload to proc it as fast as possible. Add in Radiant, and it's even easier to hit, only needing 2c, 2b for 7+ resilience, and netting you a 0.47s TTK (3c, 0b) up to 6 resilience.

// Randy's Throwing Knife (PvP first-choice roll)

Ricochet Rounds add more stability (and a bit more range too - which never hurts), ideally together with a Stability Masterwork. For kill-chaining, Discord in the first trait column as your support perk pairs perfectly with Harmony in the second column as the signature perk. Both proc on the same condition, for the same duration and add similar boosts as a combination of Under Pressure and Snapshot Sights, with a 15% damage boost that reduces TTK to 0.7s (3c, 1b). Alternatively, Cascade Point reduces TTK to 0.56s (4c, 1b), which could be hilarious for a meme or two.

Precision auto-rifles have a fairly competitive base TTK of 0.8s  with 6 crits and a body shot, and Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b). There are 12 options in the two trait columns so, if you're looking for a good roll it's worth spending time resetting your reputation to get extra perk options - five resets give you the best chance of up to three options in each trait column, but three resets gives you a chance at two per column. Positive Outlook's stats are okay - Range is high, and the Omolon origion trait gives stability boosts in the top half of the magazine, but Aim Assistance is the lowest of any subfamily peer. The frame perk means you can ignore the Recoil Direction stat, and just focus on extra range and stability with Smallbore and Ricochet Rounds ideally together with a Range Masterwork. For a duelling roll, Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column as a support perk should keep your shots on target, while Eye of the Storm in the second column as the signature perk will make crits easier to hit if you're in a gunfight.

// Laser Painter (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Projection Fuse, Moving Target, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast 298 with @Legoleflash and @illPhysics (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0DVRUKwBeWHMYkkHHHKa3K?si=c339236f5b3444e6). First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining. As with any LFR, you'll be able to kill pretty much anything with a crit in PvP. There are 12 options in the two trait columns so, if you're looking for a good roll it's worth spending time resetting your reputation to get extra perk options - five resets give you the best chance of up to three options in each trait column, but three resets gives you a chance at two per column. Laser Painter's stats are okay, but there's nothing that makes this stand out. If you're going to tuck one away in the hope that LFRs get a buff at some time in future, go all into range without harming other stats - Hammer-Forged Rifling as the barrel and Projection FRuse as the battery, with a Range Masterwork. Moving Target in the first trait column as the support perk makes the reticule a little stickier and it is possible in theory to one-hit-kill bodyshot, with Golden Tricorn in the second column as the signature perk, with three surge mods, and really that's about the best you can do. Recommended MW: Range, with a Targeting Adjustor mod. Tags: PvP, PvP-KillClip, PvP-God, M+KB, Controller

The Season 21 Iron Banner fusion rifle is our first Strand version. Adaptives can feel inconsisstent, needing 5 bolts for 6 resilience in 0.83s or under or 6 bolts from 7 to 10 in 0.86s. Pressurized Precision has good stats except for Aim Assistance is only 43. Lego insists that with enough range, stability is less of an issue, so go all in on both controller and M+KB - Full bore in the barrel and Projection Fuse in the battery pushes out a six-bolt kill to 20m+. Add in Moving Target in the first trait column as the support perk for an additional 10 Aim Assistance and ADS strafe speed, and then Rangefinder as your second column signature perk pushes out your damage fall-off so you'll be able to outshoot other adaptives - with a six bolt-kill out to the mid 20 metre mark.
