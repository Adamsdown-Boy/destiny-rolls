title:Legoleflash 1 - Riptide
description:Reprised Season 28 Riptide, discussed and play-tested in the "Riptide 2.0 Dethrones Number One Fusion Rifle" video (https://youtu.be/IvsMxN8ssuU?si=MAh44Bne8KHACqx0).

// Riptide - PvP Duelling god 1
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Projection Fuse), (Overflow, Under Pressure, Built to Blast), (Closing Time)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@Legoleflash (PvP PvP-Duel PvP-God M+KB Controller): God-roll PvP for duelling in 3s and 6s. The reprised Riptide is, at time of writing, an S-Tier special option - with the right build and perks, even bordering on oppressive. The @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, shows a base charge time for rapid-fire fusions of 533ms - nerfed from 500ms in the v9.50 patch and a 7-bolt kill, out of 9 bolts fired. In practice, it's difficult to detect any charge time nerf in-game, though. The stats aren't great compared to other rapid fire fusions, but as the only one that offers tiered rolls, you can enhance barrel, mag, weapon mods and origin traits to fill all of the stat gaps at Tiers 4 and 5 - that means a Range that's potentially 17 more than the previous version's max. You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/2297554989 for yourself. Range with the barrel and battery perks is key to controlling the recoil - ideally without any stat penalties. In the first trait perk column, Under Pressure seem like the obvious pick, for the improved stability and accuracy at the bottom of the battery - and it is really good, but if you can put together two Ferropotent and two Twofold Crown armour pieces together, you open up the option of Overflow for instant ammo refills on ammo pickup. Ferropotent ×2 gains damage and flinch resistance while your shields regenerate, while Twofold Crown ×2 grants a chunk of health on ammo pickup, which all combine for a go-faster play loop. A third option is Built to Blast - given how easy Woven Mail, Frost Armor or Void Overshields are to generate, the additional stability and Aim Assist are very noticable. In the second column Closing Time is the best choice, adding +10 Range, +25 Handling and a ×0.90 handling animation scalar at max effect. Both Origin Traits are useful - Roar of Battle procs after dealing or receiving damage consistently every 0.65s for 2s boosts handling and stability by +10 each for 6s (7s when enhanced), or Wild Card generates 3 Telesto-like bolts on a Guardian kill which persist for 10.5s or until detonated to soften or finish opponents, with a 6s cooldown between procs. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a Range enhanced mod, or your choice depending on your play style.|tags:PvP PvP-Duel PvP-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@Legoleflash (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE god roll for burst damage against Banes, Elites, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Riptide is a rapid-fire frame FR, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic as they're still the best "easy fusion" subfamily. The stats aren't great compared to other rapid fire fusions, but as the only weapon that offers tiers, you can enhance barrel, mag, weapon mods and origin traits to fill all of the stat gaps at Tiers 4 and 5. You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/2297554989 for yourself. Range with the barrel perk really helps with controlling the recoil - ideally you're looking for a one without any stat penalties. For the barrey perk, Enhanced Battery provides maximum capacity without any reload penalty. This is the only rapid fire in game that rolls with both Cornered, for a ×0.85 charge time scaler when you're within 15m of two enemies. Pair that with reduces charge time to ×0.9 and boosts damage by ×1.2 for 2s (2.5s when enhanced) after a kill or landing all the bolts in a burst. Together that's 407.745ms, which is the fastest possible charge time that doesn't require a kill, and without any penalty to damage. If you're lucky, you'll drop one with the rare Accelerated Assault Origin Trait which on scoring 3 hits within 1.2s will refill 10% of the battery and boost damage by ×1.05 (×1.06 enhanced) which is a natural choice for Controlled Burst. But, if not, both Origin Traits are useful - Roar of Battle procs after dealing or receiving damage consistently every 0.65s for 2s boosts handling and stability by +10 each for 6s (7s enhanced), or Wild Card generates Telesto-like bolts on an enemy kill which persist for 10.5s, with a 6s cooldown between procs.

Together that's 407.745ms, which is the fastest possible charge time that doesn't require a kill, and without any penalty to damage. If you're lucky, you'll drop one with the rare Accelerated Assault Origin Trait which on scoring 3 hits within 1.2s will refill 10% of the battery and boost damage by ×1.05 (×1.06 enhanced) which is a natural choice for Controlled Burst. But, if not, both Origin Traits are useful - Roar of Battle procs after dealing or receiving damage consistently every 0.65s for 2s boosts handling and stability by +10 each for 6s (7s enhanced), or Wild Card generates Telesto-like bolts on an enemy kill which persist for 10.5s, with a 6s cooldown between procs. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a Charge Time enhanced mod, or your choice depending on your play style.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Riptide - PvE Majors good 1
//notes: // (Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Enhanced Battery), (Overflow, Auto-Loading Holster), (Chill Clip, Controlled Burst, Vorpal Weapon)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@Legoleflash (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): Good PvE roll for burst damage against Banes, Elites, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Riptide is a rapid-fire frame FR, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic as they're still the best "easy fusion" subfamily. The stats aren't great compared to other rapid fire fusions, but as the only weapon that offers tiers, you can enhance barrel, mag, weapon mods and origin traits to fill all of the stat gaps at Tiers 4 and 5. You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/1323862250 for yourself. Range with the barrel perk really helps with controlling the recoil - ideally you're looking for a one without any stat penalties. For the barrey perk, Enhanced Battery provides maximum capacity without any reload penalty. You've got a choice of reload perks in the first trait perk column - Overflow to refill the battery and double the capacity (×2.2 when enhanced) on ammo pickup, or Auto-Loading Holster to reload in your backpack. Then in the second column, particularly when paired with Overflow, there's Chill Clip for Stasis synergy, Controlled Burst for good burst damage or Vorpal Weapon for a flat ×1.15 damage boost against orange and yellow bars with no setup. If you're lucky, you'll drop one with the rare Accelerated Assault Origin Trait which on scoring 3 hits within 1.2s will refill 10% of the battery and boost damage by ×1.05 (×1.06 enhanced) which is a natural choice for Controlled Burst.
