// Ergo Sum test
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Heavy Guard), (Wave Sword Frame, Caster Frame, Lightweight Frame), Arc Conductor
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 113 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor adds in end-game content. Ergo Sum - the literal Latin translation of "Therefore I am" - is the first special ammo sword can comes with combinations of perks for virtually every use case. The blade perk of choice is Enduring Blade or Hungry Edge - Jagged Edge makes almost no difference to damage output when you're Transcendent, and with picking up less ammo from special bricks, total ammo is more important. Swordmaster's Guard is the guard perk of choice, increasing the heavy attack charge rate, but Heavy Guard is worth looking at if you do ever guard against damage with a sword. For a whole load or ridiculous fun, Arc Conductor on a Wave Frame, Caster or Lightweight sword gives you arc resistance on a heavy attack, chaining lightning for 10-15m around you to make it an add-clearing machine. The Transcendent Duellist origin trait provides +2.5% light and darkness transcendance energy on kills and, while you're transcendent, adds +50 to the sword's charge rate, improves prismatic grenade regeneration speed on sword damage, boosts Ergo Sum's sword damage by +44% damage boost and extends transcendence on a kill. The catalyst is worth chasing, returning ammo on prismatic grenade hits.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller
