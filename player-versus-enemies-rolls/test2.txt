// Ribbontail - PvE Minors god roll AB 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Light Battery, Tactical Battery, Enhanced Battery), (Subsistence), (Killing Tally, Detonator Beam)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v9.0.0.5 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for clearing Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Like all Trace Rifles in the current sandbox, Ribbontail doesn't keep up in terms of raw damage output with rocket sidearms or pulse rifles, but does still have a role for activities that need you to have a weapon with a big magazine and deep reserves. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are pretty decent - d2foundry.gg calculates that 60 Range equates to 20.86m hipfire and 33.37m when ADS before damage falloff, 85 Stability is ×1.2031 flinch resist at base, 53 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, and 44 Reload Speed is a 2.06s reload. Ammo Generation is 48, Recoil Direction is 100, and Zoom is 16. Bumping up Handling with the barrel perk will make the gunfeel noticibly snappier. In the battery perk slot, Light Mag boosts Handling further, or go for a perk that helps with Reload Speed or battery capacity. For an all-round general use roll, in the first trait perk column Subsistence will refill 10% of the battery (20% when enhanced) on kills - this pairs well with Killing Tally for up to a ×1.3 damage boost after three kills until stow or reload, or Detonator Beam procs an AoE explosion after 25 hits (20 when enhanced), to help deal with add crowds. The Tenacity Origin Trait is solid in PvE, stack up to ×30 on kills, with each stack providing a ×1.005 boost (so up to ×1.15 - the same as Frenzy), and +2 to both Handling an Reload, until you're killed. If you're interested, a ribbontail is a type of stingray native to the Indo-Pacific region. Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods. |tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Lustrous Helm - Titan
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 14 from 12 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bhcY40IAVpSlQ0iaW50v0?si=8d157a1a4bdb4770) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-EndGame): Fantastic set bonus for both two-piece (Photogalvanic) and four-piece (Cauterize) with solar subclasses. You can proc Photogalvanic for additional flinch resistance, handling and reload speed with healing from any source, including Heal Clip, and Restoration continually re-procs the effect. Cauterize provides 35HP for three solar kills within about 3s of each other - so just over half of Cure ×1 (60HP).|tags:PvE PvE-EndGame
