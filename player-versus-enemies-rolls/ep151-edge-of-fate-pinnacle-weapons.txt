//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for use against minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with a Solar build. Pre Astyanax IV returns, reprised from Season 22 with refreshed perk set. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are okay, which is helped at Tier 4/5 when bowstring and arrow perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 33 Stability is ×1.0625 flinch resistance and a 0.40s perfect draw window, 50 Handling is 0.59s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.45s stow speed, and 40 Reload Speed is a 0.78s reload. The standard play with bows is to use the bowstring perk to reduce Draw Time, and the arrow perk to improve Accuracy. There's no Archer's Tempo in the first trait perk slot, so the best alternative is Successful Warm-Up, which reduces Draw Time to ×0.625 for 6s after a kill, with additional kills extending the timer by 4s up to a maximum of 20s. However, you could also double down on solar perks to combine Incandescent, great for crowd control, spreading +30 Scorch stacks to adds within 4m on a Minor add kill (+45 stacks within 8m for orange and yellow bars), with Burning Ambition in the second. This procs a +10 scorch stack on tougher targets after 2 hits (1 when enhanced) with +10 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. If you're interested, the literal translation means "Before Astyanax". Astyanax (“Lord of the City”), in Greek legend, is the Trojan popular nickname for the son of the city's greatest warrior, Prince Hector of Troy, and his wife Andromache. The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 3 arrows hitting will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s. Otherwise, Wild Card is always fun, providing a chance to drop Telesto-like "experimental submunitions" on kills. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller)

// Lionfish-4fr - PvE Utility god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Enhanced Battery, Particle Repeater), (Reconstruction), (Chill Clip)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice utility PvE roll in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Lionfish-4fr is the rapid-fire replacement for the Riptide that's probably been gathering dust in your vault. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good, and that's helped further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and battery perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that Range of 21 translates to 11.58m hipfire and 15.05m ADS before damage drop-off, 33 Stability is ×1.0162 flinch resistance, 53 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 46 Reload Speed is a 2.05s reload (1.64s when empty, with the rapid-fire frame intrinsic), Magazine Size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 23. With rapid fire fusion rifles shooting 9 bolts, you might need some help with controlling recoil from the barrel perk, and you can use the battery perk either bump up battery size or help control the recoil with a little extra stability. In the first trait perk column, there are some decent options but it's difficult to look past Reconstruction to refill 25% of the battery every 6s (5.5s when enhanced), overflowing to 200% of capacity. In the second column, Chill Clip is still there as a good add control perk to apply 40 stacks of Stasis slow to the target and enemies in 4m with any shot in the top half of the base battery (so with Reconstruction on a battery capacity of 8, that would be 12 Chill Clip shots) - also excellent for disrupting annoying Overload Champions. The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 11 bolts hitting (easy to do with two shots) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s. Otherwise, Veist Stinger has a 10% chance to refill 25% of your base battery on a hit. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

For both burst damage and a backup sustained damage weapon against orange and yellow bar enemies, you can use this overfilled battery with either Controlled Burst for ×1.2 damage and ×0.9 charge time for 2s when landing all the bolts in a shot, or Reservoir Burst for ×1.25 damage and an explosive AoE on a kill with any shot when the battery is full or overflowed - so, wit Reconstruction, the first 9 shots when the battery capacity is the maximum of 8 shots.

// Theodolite - PvE Minor god 1

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for add clearing in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Theodolite is the first energy slot variant of the Mountaintop micro-missile frame and, like it's sibling offers a lightweight frame's +20 to mobility and ×1.0625 base movement speed and explosive self-damage at ×0.675 of normal. At base, by comparison with its peer, the stats are good, which makes them very good at Tier 4/5 when barrel and battery perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 75 Velocity translates to 58.40m/s, 23 Stability is ×1.0038 flinch resistance, 65 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.16s reload, and total ammo is 20. There's no reason to deviate from the usual recommendation of Quick Launch (or maybe Smart Drift Control) to improve Handling and Velocity. Spike Grenades aren't as required to maximise damage as they used to be, but there is still a ×1.1212 increase to impact damage - High-Velocity Rounds is also here to further boost Velocity with a useful bump to manual Reload Speed. If you're using this for a bit of add control, Reconstruction will reload a shot every 6s (5.5s when enhanced) when not firing, overflowing the mag to 2. The new to Season 27 perk Reaper's Tithe provides a damage boost for 15s for killing multiple enemies in a single instance of explosive damage - 2 stacks (that's two enemies killed) is ×1.2, 3 stacks is ×1.3 and the max 4 stacks is ×1.4. Additional kills while active extend the timer by 6s to a max of 15s (17s enhanced), but you can't "upgrade" the damage stacks beyond its initial value with additional kills. The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 3 hits (with both impact and explosive damage counting as separate hits, that's two grenades) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s. Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for grenade rocket jumping tech in both at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Theodolite is the first energy slot variant of the Mountaintop micro-missile frame and, like it's sibling offers a lightweight frame's +20 to mobility and ×1.0625 base movement speed and explosive self-damage at ×0.675 of normal. At base, by comparison with its peer, the stats are good, which makes them very good at Tier 4/5 when barrel and battery perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 75 Velocity translates to 58.40m/s, 23 Stability is ×1.0038 flinch resistance, 65 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.16s reload, and total ammo is 20. There's no reason to deviate from the usual recommendation of Quick Launch (or maybe Smart Drift Control) to improve Handling and Velocity. For movement tech, Sticky Grenades as the magazine perk will allow you to place and control the detonation of grenades manually. For rocket jumping you'll want to minimise self-damage, which Danger Zone reduces to ×0.6 - combine with the frame intrinsic and that's just ×0.405 self-damage. For a rocket jumping weapon roll the damage perk isn't really important but there are very decent options - the new to Season 27 perk Reaper's Tithe provides a damage boost for 15s for killing multiple enemies in a single instance of explosive damage - 2 stacks (that's two enemies killed) is ×1.2, 3 stacks is ×1.3 and the max 4 stacks is ×1.4.

// Mint Retrograde - PvE Major god 1
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), (Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Tactical Mag), (Rewind Rounds), (Master of Arms, One for All, Chain Reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Elites, Banes, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Mint Retrograde is the must-have weapon from the Edge of Fate set - the first of a new subfamily of rocket-frame pulse rifles. There's no peers to compare this with, with it being the first of its kind, and d2foundry.gg hasn't yet calculated formulas for how stats translate to performance in-game. We do know that the base magazine is 5 (max 8), and total ammo is 18. The barrel perk options are ones you'd usually see on rocket launchers so, on that basis, something that improves handling and velocity is always welcome. In the magazine perk slot, look for one that can bump up the mag size. In the first trait perk column, Rewind Rounds is probably the most useful for burst damage, refilling 60% (70% when enhanced) of hits back into the magazine when empty - each round of a three-round burst has both impact and explosive damage, so you can total 6 hits per burst, should be able to completely refill your mag each time its been emptied. For damage, you can use One For All and spray and pray a burst into an add group to proc the ×1.35 damage for 10s (1 1s when enhanced), Master of Arms is a reliable ×1.15 damage for 7s after a first kill, increasing to ×1.25 for 4s on a second kill (8s and 5s when enhanced), or Chain Reaction can help soften up groups with the AoE explosion on kills and has the added benefit when enhanced of boosting Ammo Generation by +20. The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 11 hits (which, from Mint Retrograde, can be either impact or explosive damage, so two 3-round bursts is 12 hits) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s.

There's no peers to compare this with, with it being the first of its kind, and d2foundry.gg hasn't yet calculated formulas for how stats translate to performance in-game. We do know that the base magazine is 5 (max 8), and total ammo is 18. The barrel perk options are ones you'd usually see on rocket launchers so, on that basis, something that improves handling and velocity is always welcome. In the magazine perk slot, look for one that can bump up the mag size. In the first trait perk column for a boss damage roll, Envious Arsenal will reload in the background while you're doing damage with other weapons to proc Bait and Switch or Elemental Honing. Alternatively, Rewind Rounds is also solid, refilling 60% (70% when enhanced) of hits back into the magazine when empty - each round of a three-round burst has both impact and explosive damage, so you can total 6 hits per burst, should be able to completely refill your mag each time its been emptied. For damage, you can use Bait and Switch for ×1.3 damage for 10s (11s when enhanced) for cycling through weapons, or Elemental Honing is great on Prismatic subclasses for sustained damage offering up to ×1.35 damage at five stacks for 20s (23s enhanced) when you can apply damage from the four other energy types (Stasis, Arc, Solar and Void). The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 11 hits (which, from Mint Retrograde, can be either impact or explosive damage, so two 3-round bursts is 12 hits) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s. Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 151 from 26 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2i6uazTPn8rdPCD6amcjSc?si=C-kdbOCvTCqhRYq7M8zYnw) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage against bosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Outrageous Fortune has had a glow-up since it first appeared in Season 4 and, as a rapid-fire grenade launcher is in the stronger subfamily for damage output offering better ammo reserves and a ×0.8 reload scalar when the mag's empty. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats aren't great, but can be improved at Tier 4/5 when barrel and battery perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 50 Velocity translates to 48.80m/s, 29 Stability is ×1.0112 flinch resistance, 25 Handling is 0.48s ready, 0.45s ADS and 0.43s stow speed, 20 Reload Speed is a 3.66s reload (2.93s with the frame intrinsic when the mag's empty), Magazine Size is 5 (max 8) and total ammo is 29 (max 30). The Handling could definitely do with improving with the barrel perk. In the magazine perk slot, Spike Grenades does still boost impact damage by ×1.125 (which is a ×1.033 damage boost overall), but options that increase magazine size are worth considering as well. For boss damage, the combination of Envious Arsenal (which also increases Ammo Generation by +20 when enhanced) to refill the magazine when you cycle through your other weapons, and Bait and Switch, which boosts damage by ×1.3 for 10s on the same proc condition is a very natural pairing. The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 3 hits (with both impact and explosive damage counting as separate hits, that's two grenades) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s. Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Outrageous Fortune has had a glow-up since it first appeared in Season 4 and, as a rapid-fire grenade launcher is in the stronger subfamily for damage output offering better ammo reserves and a ×0.8 reload scalar when the mag's empty. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats aren't great, but can be improved at Tier 4/5 when barrel and battery perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 50 Velocity translates to 48.80m/s, 29 Stability is ×1.0112 flinch resistance, 25 Handling is 0.48s ready, 0.45s ADS and 0.43s stow speed, 20 Reload Speed is a 3.66s reload (2.93s with the frame intrinsic when the mag's empty), Magazine Size is 5 (max 8) and total ammo is 29 (max 30). The Handling could definitely do with improving with the barrel perk. In the magazine perk slot, Spike Grenades does still boost impact damage by ×1.125 (which is a ×1.033 damage boost overall), but options that increase magazine size are worth considering as well. For burst damage,in the first trait perk column, Field Prep grants +50 to Reload Speed with a ×0.8 animation scalar to both reload and ready/stow animations, and when enhanced increases Ammo Generation by a hefty +30. Pair that in the second column with Explosive Light for a ×1.6 boost to explosive damage - that's ×1.53 overall - for up to 6 shots (7 when enhanced) just for picking up power orbs, or Binary Orbit which will probably proc in the background as you damage enemies with darkness energy damage during combat for a ×1.25 boost to damage for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced). The Problem Solver Origin Trait is very good for PvE when facing orange and yellow bars - 3 hits (with both impact and explosive damage counting as separate hits, that's two grenades) will proc to exhaust them and reduce damage output to ×0.75 for 5s and grant +50 to Reload Speed and Handling for 10s.
