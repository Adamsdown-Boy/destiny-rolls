@title:Season of Defiance Devrim Kay VIII and Foundry weapons
@description:Season 20 new and reprised weapons with the Field Tested or Foundry origin trait

// Battle Scar (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds), Shoot to Loot, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too. Recommended MW: TBH anything will work - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor, Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

To improve your gunfeel, in the first trait slot as you r support perk, Perpetual Motion adds a decent bump to handling, stability and reload speed, or if you want extra range then Keep Away boosts that, reload speed and accuracy. Osmosis, as your signature perk in the second trait column is fairly rare and will pick up any of the energy synergies from your subclass (say, volatile rounds when that's procced by a void ability) - if you haven't already got a pulse rifle with the perk, then this would be worth hanging on to.

// Harsh Language (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and burst damage to Majors in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher.

In the first trait column Envious Assassin can give you up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon, but Field Prep, Threat Detector or Stats for All are all worth considering as a support perk. Void subclasses provide a great toolkit to trigger the second stack of Golden Tricorn for 50% bonus damage, in the second trait column for your signature perk.

// Hand in Hand (PvE first-choice roll)
// Full Choke, Tactical Mag, Slideshot, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently (as at v7.0.0.6) in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much). As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

Handling is the standard play for shotguns, so Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling are your best choices. Assault Mag brings your RPM up to 60 and also boosts stability - maybe not so essential with a slower firing shottie, but still nice. As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full, and you can take advantage of the arc toolkit to proc the second stack of Golden Tricorn as your signature perk in the second trait column to boost damage by 50%, as well as proccing useful arc verbs, like Blinding with Spark of Beacons.

// Nasreddin (PvE first-choice roll)
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, 
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

// Senuna SI6 (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Light Mag), Feeding Frenzy, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling), (Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Envious Assassing, Fourth Time's The Charm, Rapid Hit), (Firing Line, Focused Fury)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading! Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-PvE-MajorSpec, BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. If you looking for a fun add-clear weapon for bulkier minors, with an eye towards Incandescent as your signature perk in the second trait slot, then maximise your Blast Radius with your barrel and mag perks, and masterwork - Volatile Launch or Confined Launch with High-Explosive Ordnance. Envious Assassin overflows the magazine from primary and special weapon kills, or Field Prep adds bonus reserves and reload speed as you options for your support park in the first trait column. Both add utility to Incandescent, and you can add Ember of Ashes for more scorch stacks and faster ignitions.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for getting your own back on Threshers. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. More of a niche roll, and not really one to shape yourself, but if you want to use the Hakke origin trait to really take revenge on Cabal Threshers, then this is probably the only use case you'll ever find for Full Court as your signature perk in the second trait column, as your shots will probably have plenty of hang time (it's time in the air, rather than distance travelled that's important) to passively proc the higher end of the damage boost! Countermass is the only barrel perk that neither boosts blast radius (reducing Spike Grenade impact damage) or Velocity (faster projectiles mean they have to travel further for Full Court's damage bonus to proc). As your first trait column support perk to pair with Full Court, Field Prep's bonus reserves and reload speed or Envious Assassin's magazine overflow are both viable.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag. As the support perk, in the first trait column, Feeding Frenzy boosts reload speed further after kills - your solar ignition kills from Incandescent will add to the stacks, particularly when paired with Ember of Ashes.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for beefier Minor add-clear in general content. The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. This is one of the first ARs with Target Lock, so if you choose that as your second trait column signature perk to build towards, Alloy Mag makes a lot of sense as the magazine perk - you need to be firing continuously until the mag is empty to build damage stacks. Although generally more of a PvP perk, Zen Moment as the support perk helps with the lowish stability to keep shots on target for Target Lock's stacking damage boost. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB
