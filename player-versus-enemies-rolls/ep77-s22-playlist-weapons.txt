// Unending Tempest (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Demolitionist, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. We'll be using traits to boost handling and reload speed, so you can use the barrel and mag options to push up stability as much as you can to improve control. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's rare to get double damage perks outside of raid weapons, but Gutshot Straight in the first trait column boosts bodyshot damage by a further 10% - with a spray and pray weapon like an SMG, this could be the unique perk combination to chase. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

You'll appreciate a mix of handling, stability and reload speed from your barrel and mag perks. Fluted Barrel is the obvious top pic for the barrel, but Smallbore is a decent alternative, and then Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell boost the stats you need from the mag. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as a support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Adrenaline Junkie is a natural pairing, as is Collective Action from the elemental pickups you can generate from grenades.

For the trait combination, Subsistence as the support perk and Surrounded as the signature perk can work, even in end-game activity - the 40% damage boost from Surrounded should proc the partial mag refill from Subsistence fairly frequently to keep you in the fight for longer.

But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. For M+KB, focus on range with your barrel and mag perks - stability is less useful and you can use trait perks to help boost handling and reload speed. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus. Recommended MW: Range, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), (Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge, Field Prep), (Explosive Rounds, Firing Line)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).

// Qua Xaphan V (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhed Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds), (Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge), (Target Lock, Frenzy, Firing Line)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Boss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Qua Xaphan V (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhed Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds), Field Prep, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. If you want to use this as a heavy scout rifle, for add clear, Field Prep, for the boost to reserves and reload speed is the best option in the first trait column as the support perk, and Destabilizing Rounds gives you access to volatility effects even if you're not using a void subclass, for great add-clearing. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Point of the Stag (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Elastic String, Polymer String, Flexible String), (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), Archer's Tempo, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Solid stats by comparison with its Precision Bow peers, and some decent PvE traits mean this is worth focusing a few Iron Banner engrams if you've not already got a decent one. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Point of the Stag (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear in general content. Point of the Stag has solid stats by comparison with its Precision Bow peers, and some decent PvE traits mean this is worth focusing a few Iron Banner engrams if you've not already got a decent one. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Archer's Tempo is the usual top choice as the support perk to speed up draw time, and Dragonfly as the second trait column signature perk is great for clearing groups of minor adds in general content. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for clearing beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The good news is that reprised Guiding Sight is now a Strand Scout Rifle. the bad news is that it's still a high-Impact frame, so it's the least competitive subtype. The stats are decent, so this might be an easier to obtain option, if you've not got a Strand scout already. With the barrel, you can buff some of the low stats - Handling and Stability, and then the mag can help with the reload speed, or just choose from one of the combat effect mags. The pairing of Enlightened Action as the first column support trait to boost Handling and Reload Speed and Precision Instrument in the second column signature perk for an escalating damage buff on crits is a natural pairing to help with long-range add clearing.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and Minor Spec enemies in general content. The good news is that reprised Guiding Sight is now a Strand Scout Rifle. the bad news is that it's still a high-Impact frame, so it's the least competitive subtype. The stats are decent, so this might be an easier to obtain option, if you've not got a Strand scout already. With the barrel, you can buff some of the low stats - Handling and Stability, and then the mag can help with the reload speed, or just choose from one of the combat effect mags. For Strand synergy, Hatchling as the second trait column signature perk generates Threadlings on a crit kill - make sure you have the Thread of Generation fragment to make the most of them. As the first column support column perk to work with Hatchling, you could choose from Demolitionist (and even more Threadlings for Warlocks), or Enlightened Action or Perpetual Motion add nice bumps to gunfeel stats. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

// Pre Astyanax IV (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Elastic String, Polymer String, Flexible String), (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), (Archer's Tempo, Shoot to Loot), Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The literal translation means "Before Astyanax". Astyanax (“Lord of the City”), in Greek legend, is the Trojans' popular nickname for the son of the city's greatest warrior, Prince Hector of Troy, and his wife Andromache. If you haven't got a well-rolled solar Precision bow, this is your chance - the stats are poor, but there are still decent trait combos to chase. If you do, then you can happily pass this by. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Archer's Tempo is the usual reliable choice as the support perk to speed up draw time, but you might also look at Shoot to Loot for picking up ammo bricks remotely in end-game content. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Explosive Head adds a passive boost to damage and adds flinch, and increases the radius for a Shoot to Loot ammo pickup. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the first choice for the barrel, with Corkscrew Rifling as an alternate choice. Appended Mag adds 2 "shots", or Tactical Mag adds one, but also helps with Stability and Reload Speed. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads. Recommended MW: Stability (with Enlightened Action) or Handling (with Perpetual Motion), with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.

Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Warden's Law (Adept) (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Appended Mag, Tactical Mag), (Enlightened Action, Perpetual Motion), Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the first choice for the barrel, with Corkscrew Rifling as an alternate choice. Appended Mag adds 2 "shots", or Tactical Mag adds one, but also helps with Stability and Reload Speed. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads. Recommended MW: Stability (with Enlightened Action) or Handling (with Perpetual Motion), with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game (as at v7.2.0.3), and a new and very chasable trait pairing.

Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game (as at v7.2.0.3), and a new and very chasable trait pairing. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the top choice, and then Corkscrew Rifling is the alternate. Flared Magwell layers on reload speed and a bit more stability, or you can use any of the combat effect mag perks to good effect. In the first trait column as the support perk, Heal Clip is the new hotness for a burst of Cure for you and your nearby fireteam when reloading after a kill. In the second column signature perk slot, you could pair it with Incandescent for some solar synergy, Golden Tricorn for the damage buffs or Precision Instrument for escalating single target crit damage.

// Igneous Hammer (Adept) (PvE backup roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds), Heal Clip, (Incandescent, Golden Tricorn, Precision Instrument)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. Backup PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game (as at v7.2.0.3), and a new and very chasable trait pairing. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the top choice, and then Corkscrew Rifling is the alternate. Flared Magwell layers on reload speed and a bit more stability, or you can use any of the combat effect mag perks to good effect. In the first trait column as the support perk, Heal Clip is the new hotness for a burst of Cure for you and your nearby fireteam when reloading after a kill. In the second column signature perk slot, you could pair it with Incandescent for some solar synergy, Golden Tricorn for the damage buffs or Precision Instrument for escalating single target crit damage. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Cataphract GL3 (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Hard launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator), (Augmented Drum, Spike Grenades), Envious Assassin, Bait and Switch
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice. Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity, with a damage-boosting (Boss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller
