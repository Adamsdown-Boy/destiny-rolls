@description:Reprised weapons dropping from Festival of the Lost with Scouting Party Origin Trait

// Mechabre (PvE first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, (Appended Mag, Flared Magwell), Auto-Loading Holster, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for burst damage against Majors. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look no further than Fluted Barrel to boost Handling and Stability. It's difficult to get to five in the mag to make Triple Tap proc twice, so go for Appended Mag instead to add an extra round, or Flared Magwell for Reload Speed and Stability boosts. In the first trait column, Auto-Loading Holster lets you swap to another weapon to keep DPS up, and in the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles. Recommended MW: Handling, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-God, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-EndGame, Controller, MKB

You want to make your reloads as fast as possible, so Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are you mag choices. In the first trait column, Perpetual Motion boosts Reload Speed even more so that when you get your first add kill, you can reload as fast as possible to proc Jolt with Voltshot in the second column for additional damage against a Major or Boss and add clear of any Minors nearby.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for Barrier Champions and match game endgame content. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Dreadful stats compared to any other energy rapid-fire pulse rifle as at v6.2.5.1, but it's the only solar one currently available. Wonky recoil direction of 50, so you'll need to straighten that out as much as possible with a Recoil Direction barrel, Stability Barrel or a bit of both. Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage to shields in your mag slot. Perpetual Motion boosts gunfeel stats passively and, if you don't already have a better solar pulse rifle with Adaptive Munitions, then you should always have one in your vault to both deal with Barrier Champions, when the mod's around, or for dealing with shields in match game activities.
