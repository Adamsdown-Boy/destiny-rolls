// Fatebringer - PvE Minors god 1
// (Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Alloy Mag, (Kinetic tremors, Explosive Payload), One For All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor add groups in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Fan favourite Fatebringer is still worth a look if you're looking for a strong kinetic slot primary which by default as a kinetic weapon, does ×1.1 damage against Minor adds. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers (particularly if you ignore the stat monster that is Midnight Coup) - 46 Range and 14 Zoom equates to 30.21m ADS and 20.14m hipfire, 57 Stability is ×1.1624 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 46 Reload Speed is a 2.63s reload and Recoil Direction is 98. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Stability and Range, and Alloy Mag is the pick of the magazine perks, with an up to ×0.8 scalar to Reload Speed. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - Kinetic Tremors procs after 6 hits (5 when enhanced) for additional target and AoE damage or Explosive Payload adds damage (×1.1 to crit and ×1.15 to body) and flinch. Both pair well with One For All - both helping proc the ×1.35 damage boost for hitting 3 enemies, and both inheriting the boost to their own damage. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create power orbs or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Vision of Confluence - PvE Minors god 1
// Fluted Barrel, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Incandescent, (Paracausal Affinity, Frenzy, Explosive Payload, Firefly)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Unfortunately, while Vision of Confluence is a solid scout rifle, it's in the subfamily with the lowest damage output and there are other options which offer much the same set of perks. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 46 Range and 20 Zoom equates to 74.93m ADS and 37.46m hipfire, 42 Stability is ×1.1495 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.04s reload and Recoil Direction is 75 (but with the Precision frame intrinsic, you can pretty much ignore the RD stat). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help out a little with Reload Speed and Stability. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - this is the only primary that can roll with Incandescent, with kills spreading scorch and AoE damage. Any ignition kills will proc Paracausal Affinity's ×1.2 damage boost, making this a natural pairing, but Frenzy for ×1.15 damage and maxxed Handling and Reload Speed, or Explosive Payload for ×1.1 crit and ×1.15 bodyshot damage and Firefly for a solar AoE detonation and +50 Reload Speed will also help spread scorch damage over a wider area, to help even more with add clearing. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Firesprites or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

// Found Verdict - PvE Majors god 1
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Pugilist, Rewind Rounds, Slideshot), One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75. Base magazine size is 4 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 20/22/24/25 (max 25). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For burst damage, the first trait perk column offers useful utility perks - Pugilist is great for melee builds or Rewind Rounds and Slideshot offer ways to bypass reload, or Threat Detector and Threat Remover both boost Handling and Reload Speed, looking towards One-Two Punch for a ×2 boost to elemental melee damage when hitting all 12 of your shotgun pellets (10 pellets when enhanced). The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves.

// Found Verdict - PvE Majors god 2
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Rewind Rounds, Slideshot, Threat Detector, Discord), Trench Barrel
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75. Base magazine size is 4 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 20/22/24/25 (max 25). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For a burst damage roll, the first trait perk column offers useful utility reload perks - both Rewind Rounds and Slideshot offer ways to bypass reloading, Threat Detector improves handling and reload speed significantly when in CQC, or Discord can magic ammo out of thin air for 7s after a kill with another weapon. All of those work well with Trench Barrel, boosting damage by ×1.5 and Handing and Reload Speed by +30 for three shots or 5s. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

// Found Verdict - PvE Majors god 3
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Threat Detector, Threat Remover), Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75. Base magazine size is 4 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 20/22/24/25 (max 25). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For a burst damage roll, the first trait perk column offers useful utility reload perks - both Threat Detector and Threat Remover improves handling and reload speed when procced. All of those work well with Voltshot, jolting targets for additional target and AoE damage, and synergising with arc build fragments. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For a burst damage roll, the first trait perk column offers useful utility reload perks - both Rewind Rounds and Slideshot offer ways to bypass reloading, Threat Detector improves handling and reload speed significantly when in CQC, or Discord can magic ammo out of thin air for 7s after a kill with another weapon. All of those work well with Trench Barrel, boosting damage by ×1.5 and Handing and Reload Speed by +30 for three shots or 5s. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Adept Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

// Found Verdict (Timelost) - PvE majors god 3
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Threat Detector, Threat Remover), Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75. Base magazine size is 4 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 20/22/24/25 (max 25). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For a burst damage roll, the first trait perk column offers useful utility reload perks - both Threat Detector and Threat Remover improves handling and reload speed when procced. All of those work well with Voltshot, jolting targets for additional target and AoE damage, and synergising with arc build fragments. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Adept Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Praedyth's Revenge - PvE Bosses god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), Kinetic Tremors, (Bait and Switch, Elemental Honing)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Bosses in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. The combination of trait perks and the Timelost Magazine origin trait make Praedyth's Revenge a serious option for a boss special weapon when using a heavy that does damage over time. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 34 Range and 49 Zoom, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.65s reload (2.12s with the Rapid-Fire frame intrinsic when reloading from an empty magazine) and Recoil Direction is 55. Base magazine size is 6 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 30/32/35/35 (max 35). You'll need to keep hitting crits, so use the barrel perk to improve the Recoil Direction, or add Stability. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 shots to make the most of the origin trait, or look to just increase Stability or Reload Speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag. Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column gives you the option for double damage perks and AoE damage (after 3 hits, or 2 when enhanced), but remember it can only proc on a target once, so it only makes sense for one Guardian in a fireteam to be using it. The second column offers a traditional Bait and Switch for ×1.3 damage for rotating through your weapons or Elemantal Honing for up to ×1.4 damage if you can cycle through five different elemental damage types - both of these multipliers also affect Kinetic tremors damage too. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod in you aren't at 7 shots in the mag or Quick Access Sling if you are, or when fully enhanced possibly an Anti-Flinch or Tactical Mod.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Bosses in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. The combination of trait perks and the Timelost Magazine origin trait make Praedyth's Revenge a serious option for a boss special weapon when using a heavy that does damage over time. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 34 Range and 49 Zoom, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.65s reload (2.12s with the Rapid-Fire frame intrinsic when reloading from an empty magazine) and Recoil Direction is 55. Base magazine size is 6 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 30/32/35/35 (max 35). You'll need to keep hitting crits, so use the barrel perk to improve the Recoil Direction, or add Stability. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 shots to make the most of the origin trait, or look to just increase Stability or Reload Speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag. In the first trait perk column, for boss damage, look for options that bypass reload and extend your magazine - Envious Arsenal pairs perfectly with Bait and Switch, or Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm keep you shooting. The second column offers a traditional Bait and Switch for ×1.3 damage for rotating through your weapons or Elemantal Honing for up to ×1.4 damage if you can cycle through five different elemental damage types. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod in you aren't at 7 shots in the mag or Adept Stability or Counterbalance (depending on your barrel perk) if you are, or when fully enhanced possibly an Anti-Flinch or Tactical Mod. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For sustained boss damage, the first trait perk column sensible choice is Rewind Rounds - there's every chance you'll get to the end of a damage phase and never have to reload. In the second column, for damage, Killing Tally lets you hold an up to ×1.3 damage boost until reload or stow, or One for All give you a  ×1.35 boost for 10s if there are adds around to help regularly re-proc. As a utility perk option, Withering Gaze applies Weaken for 10s to boost your whole fireteam's damage by an effective ×1.15 just for ADSing for 1.5s.

Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. Base magazine size is 59 (maximum 91), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 405/451/496/498 (max 601). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For a fun roll for add clearing, the void wombo combo of Destabilizing Rounds and Demoralize spreads volatility and procs Volatile Rounds for 4.5s as well as applying Weaken for a  ×1.15 damage boost for your whole fireteam, with both synergising well with void aspects and fragments. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for going on a killing spree.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For burst damage, we have the reworked Redirection in the first column, which lets you build stacks up to 30, 3 at at time for Minor add kills, and use them 3 at a time for ×1.33 damage (2 at a time for ×1.5 when enhanced) against Majors and Bosses - so think of it as a way to bank an extra 10 or 15 shots of burst damage against against orange and yellow bar enemies enemies by killing adds. In the second column, you can add a second damage scalar with Killing Tally for up to ×1.3 damage as long as you don't reload or stow or One for All for ×1.35 damage for 10s if there are adds around to proc it. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for going on a killing spree.

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - PvE Minors god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake), (Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Tactical Mag), Destabilizing Rounds, Demoralize
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing groups of Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with void builds. Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. Base magazine size is 59 (maximum 91), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 405/451/496/498 (max 601). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For a fun roll for add clearing, the void wombo combo of Destabilizing Rounds and Demoralize spreads volatility and procs Volatile Rounds for 4.5s as well as applying Weaken for a  ×1.15 damage boost for your whole fireteam, with both synergising well with void aspects and fragments. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for going on a killing spree. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Adept Backup Mag mod. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For burst damage, we have the reworked Redirection in the first column, which lets you build stacks up to 30, 3 at at time for Minor add kills, and use them 3 at a time for ×1.33 damage (2 at a time for ×1.5 when enhanced) against Majors and Bosses - so think of it as a way to bank an extra 10 or 15 shots of burst damage against against orange and yellow bar enemies enemies by killing adds. In the second column, you can add a second damage scalar with Killing Tally for up to ×1.3 damage as long as you don't reload or stow or One for All for ×1.35 damage for 10s if there are adds around to proc it. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for going on a killing spree.

Base magazine size is 1, and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 8/9/10/11 (max 11). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling and Velocity with Quick Launch, and Impact Casing as the magazine perk boosts overall damage by ×1.022. This is the only rocket launcher that can roll Overflow, appearing in the first trait perk column, which is ×2 magazine size for collecting any ammo brick (×2.2 when enhanced, rounded up for 3 in the tube).

This is the only rocket launcher that can roll Overflow, appearing in the first trait perk column, which is ×2 magazine size for collecting any ammo brick (×2.2 when enhanced, rounded up for 5 in the tube with Bipod). Proccing the origin trait then takes this to 8 shots without reloading for excellent burst damage. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Hezen Vengeance (Timelost) - PvE Bosses god 3
// Quick Launch, Impact Casing, Envious Arsenal, Bait and Switch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Bosses in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Hezen Vengeance is in the highest rocket launcher subfamily band for damage, and the highest RPM, which already makes it an excellent choice for DPS, but it also has the highest Inventory stat of any RL currently in game, for great total ammo. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 79 Velocity equates to 39.27m/s, 55 Stability is ×1.1101 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 23 Handling is 0.57s ready, 0.48s ADS and 0.47s stow speed, 60 Reload Speed is a 2.95s reload and Recoil Direction is 65. Base magazine size is 1, and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 8/9/10/11 (max 11). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling and Velocity with Quick Launch, and Impact Casing as the magazine perk boosts overall damage by ×1.022. For sustained damage, you have the natural pairing of Envious Arsenal (enhanced it effectively adds a reserves mod so you only need two to hit maximum total ammo) and Bait and Switch in the second, to reload and gain ×1.3 bonus damage for just cycling through your weapons. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases.
