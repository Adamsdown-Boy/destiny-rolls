@title:Season 19 Dawning weapons
@description:New Seraph weapons with the Ambush origin perk and new and reprised IKELOS weapons with the Rasputin's Arsenal origin perk

// Disparity (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), (Rapid Hit, Outlaw), Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Shapeable. First-choice PvE roll for synergy with Stasis subclasses. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, but Hakke Breach Armaments, with the additional damage against stasis crystals is the choice to break crystals for a dragonfly-like burst of damage. This is the only current(as at v6.3.0.2) me aggressive frame pulse rifle in the kinetic slot, so it's worth hanging on a good roll. Correct the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and more stable. In the mag, Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are the best options, adding more stability and reload speed. To match up with Headstone, Rapid Hit and Outlaw both proc on the same condition to reward consistent crits. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts or the Veist Stinger will provide the occasional fast reload and draw. The Lightweight frame provides +20 mobility and 6.25% boost to movement, which is always useful. As with all bows, get the draw time as low as possible with Elastic String, and then recover the lost accuracy with Fiberglass Arrow Shaft.

// Tripwire Canary (PvE first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Archer's Tempo, Successful Warm-up
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts or the Veist Stinger will provide the occasional fast reload and draw. The Lightweight frame provides +20 mobility and 6.25% boost to movement, which is always useful. As with all bows, get the draw time as low as possible with Elastic String, and then recover the lost accuracy with Fiberglass Arrow Shaft. For general content, in the first trait column, Archer's Tempo rewards crit hits with even faster draw time and in the second, Successful Warm-up boosts that even further on a kill, improving damage output.

// Judgment of Kelgorath (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts but will be more use for a glaive than Hakke Breach Armaments. JoK is a new subtype for Season 19 - a slower, but harder hitting slashy shooty stick than we're used to. You're going to be in CQC, where projectile speed (governed by range) isn't quite as important, so the shield can be quite useful to survive in a crowd. Use your haft to improve charge time and shield duration, and take the extra shot from Appended Mag (Extended Mag gives you no more shots so isn't worth it). In the first trait column, Overflow on a Special or Power weapon is just so good - more than double your magazine size and it bypasses the low reload speed just for picking up a brick! Close to Melee was just built for glaives - projectile kills improve melee damage by 30%, and more kills with either projectile or melee extend the timer. Proc and go have fun.

// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, (Stats for All, Field Prep, Fourth Time's the Charm, Feeding Frenzy), Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. Tactical Mag adds a few extra shots, plus stability and reload speed. To lean into the Void 3.0 sandbox, give yourself as much ammo and uptime in the first trait column with Stats for All, Field Prep, Fourth Time's the Charm or Feeding Frenzy to take advantage of Golden Tricorn's 50% bonus damage with two stacks, using your choice of void grenade or melee. Recommended  MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// Fire and Forget (PvE first-choice roll)
(Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling), Enhanced Battery, Field Prep, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game boss DPS. Shapeable. Veist Stinger is the origin trait to use, as it procs per shot rather than per burst, which means you'll probably never need to reload. F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser. Being a stasis LFR, it's easy to get a Font of Might 25% boost to your damage if you have a Warlock putting down a Well and willing to use the Supreme Wellmaker mod, and you're using the Elemental Shards and Elemental Time Dilation mods. You'll need to keep your shots on a boss's crit spot, so maximise your stability with your barrel, and then add in an extra charge with no downsides with Enhanced Battery. For boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves (which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger), and you'll get plenty of opportunity to proc the 20% damage boost from Focused Fury once you hit six individual crits (the trait procs on individual shots rather than on bursts). Recommended  MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game add clear. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. Precisions aren't the strongest choice for PvE as at Season 19 v6.3.0.2, and the Ikelos HC's stats are pretty bad across the board, but there are a few combinations that are still interesting.

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.3 (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Full Choke), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), (Pugilist, Threat Detector), Trench Barrel
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game Major and Champion kills. Shapeable. Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. There aren't any other solar rapid-fire shotguns currently, as at Season 19 v6.3.0.2, for a direct comparison, but this has pretty much best-in-subtype stats across the board, and a range of fun perk combinations to play with. The barrel options offer better handling, stability (useful on rapid-fire shotguns), or pellet spread, while the usual magazine options of Tactical Mag for better mag size, reload and stability, or just Appended mag for the extra shot are your best choices. Either Pugilist's additional handling on a melee hit or Threat Detector's bonus stability, handling and reload speed for being in CQC pair well with Trench Barrel's 50% bonus burst damage, handlng and reload speed for three shots after a melee hit. Ideal against Majors and for finishing off stunned Champions. Recommended  MW: Handling or Reload Spped, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod.
