First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Rufus's Fury is no different and will be most people's choice for a Strand primary, and will probably only get better when the additional fragments arrive. Although, at 56, the recoil is pretty up-and-down, Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk takes the Recoil Direction to an even more controllable 86 and adds Handling. Flared Magwell or Ricochet Rounds add Stability and Reload Speed or Range and Stability in the magazine. Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with signature perks like Target Lock, where the refilled magazine allows you to reach the higher damage stacks, for damage against bulkier enemies or Frenzy for a general 15% damage bump. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

First-choice PvE roll for Light subclass synergy against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. As your first trait column support perk, Demolitionist means grenades (remember, it's 20% grenade energy for special weapon kills), which means you should have an easy way to proc Paracausal Affinity for 20% bonus damage for 6s to clear beefier Minors, and Majors. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Void subclass synergy in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still be effective to control beefier minors, and majors. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. It's unusual to be able to roll two Void perks, so the opportunity to roll Repulsor Brace in the first trait column as your support perk, for damage reduction void overshields, and Destabilizing Rounds as your signature perk in the second to spread volatility on a kill is difficult to pass up. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

// Nessa's Oblation (Adept) (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Tactical Mag, Demolitionist, Paracausal Affinity
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Light subclass synergy against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. As your first trait column support perk, Demolitionist means grenades (remember, it's 20% grenade energy for special weapon kills), which means you should have an easy way to proc Paracausal Affinity for 20% bonus damage for 6s to clear beefier Minors, and Majors. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Adept Big Ones or Taken Spec) mod.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Void subclass synergy in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still be effective to control beefier minors, and majors. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. It's unusual to be able to roll two Void perks, so the opportunity to roll Repulsor Brace in the first trait column as your support perk, for damage reduction void overshields, and Destabilizing Rounds as your signature perk in the second to spread volatility on a kill is difficult to pass up. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Acasia's Dejection is no different - this is the best legendary trace rifle as at v7.0.0.6. The recoil is already pretty easy to control with 96 Recoil Direction and 80 stability, so your barrel and battery choices are more of a bonus than gap filler. You can use this as a pseudo primary weapon with Field Prep as your first trait column support perk boosting your reserves, and Frenzy as your second column signature perk not only boosting damage by 15%, but capping out Handling and Reload Speed at 100.

// Acasia's Dejection (Adept) (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Enhanced Battery, Particle Repeater), Field Prep, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Acasia's Dejection is no different - this is the best legendary trace rifle as at v7.0.0.6. The recoil is already pretty easy to control with 96 Recoil Direction and 80 stability, so your barrel and battery choices are more of a bonus than gap filler. You can use this as a pseudo primary weapon with Field Prep as your first trait column support perk boosting your reserves, and Frenzy as your second column signature perk not only boosting damage by 15%, but capping out Handling and Reload Speed at 100. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range or Stability - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// Koraxis's Distress (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius (let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion), or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel. If you do catch a chunkier enemy, Spike Grenades is nice for a little extra impact damage, and then the unique combination of Chain Reaction as your first trait column support perk - let's face it, it's unusual to have it as a support perk - and Hatchling as the signature perk in the second trait column. Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

// Koraxis's Distress (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, you'll want the Blast Radius as large as possible - Volatile Launch and High-Explosive Ordnance add 25 and a masterwork adds another 10. Then the unique combination of Chain Reaction as your first trait column support perk - let's face it, it's unusual to have it as a support perk - and Hatchling as the signature perk in the second trait column. Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.
