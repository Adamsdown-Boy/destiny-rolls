@title:Season of Defiance weapons
@description:Season 20 weapons wit the Noble Deeds origin trait

// Perpetualis (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Extended Barrel, Smallbore), Tactical Mag, (Keep Away, Zen Moment), Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling (and boost reload speed too). Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

// Raconteur (PvE first-choice roll)
// Elastic String, Compact Arrow Shaft, Archer's Tempo, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further. Similarly, Explosive Head adds damage (and flinch) for free so is the best signature perk in the second trait column. Recommended MW: Accuracy or Draw Time, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

// Royal Executioner (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Accelerated Coils, Envious Assassin, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

Envious Assassin is a stand out support perk in the first trait column, overflowing the magazine as you get primary and power weapon kills, but Threat Detector and Lead From Gold are right up there too. This is the first solar FR to give the option of Incandescent as the signature perk in the second column, which plays into the subclass verbs for end-game add clear.

// Prodigal Return (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Disorienting Grenades, Envious Assassin, Disruption Break
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling (for faster swaps) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// Prodigal Return (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), High-Velocity Rounds, (Threadt Detector, Field Prep), Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways.

The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. With one eye towards building a weapon around Voltshot (this is the first GL with Voltshot as an option, although the jury is still out on whether that's a good idea or not) as the signature perk in the second trait column, we'll need to make the reload as fast as possible. High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too. Using Spark of Beacons gives you arc Blinding on a kill, which should make the follow-up shot after a kill, to get your Jolt damage tick, easier to hit.

// Regnant (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Spike Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for sustained boss DPS in end-game activities. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. As is usual for grenade launchers, look to increase velocity to get the grenade on target as fast as possible, and handling, for general snappiness. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your pick of the support perks, Auto-Loading Holster lets you empty the magazine and reload while you're swapped to your DPS special weapon to rinse and repeat, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

First-choice PvE roll for burst DPS against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits.

In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your support perk, Envious Assassin overflows the magazine or the most quick shots to finish off a major or stunned Champion quickly, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

// Regnant (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Volatile Launch, Linear Compensator), High-Explosive Ordnance, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot. This combination should make you a bit of a walking tank in add-dense areas, as long as you have ammo. Recommended MW: Blast Radius, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.

// Caretaker (PvE first-choice roll)
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, (Tireless Blade, Relentless Strikes), Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support park in the first trait column, Relentless Strikes don't require a kill to return ammo, so is best for chunkier adds and Majors, although Flash Counter's weaken effect is also worth considering. Majors are usually accompanied by minors, so Surrounded (especially when enhanced) or One for All as signature perks in the second trait column can both work well when you need to do damage up close.
