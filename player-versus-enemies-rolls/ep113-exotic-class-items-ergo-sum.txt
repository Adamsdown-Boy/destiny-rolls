@description:What the title says

// Relatavism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of Caliban, Spirit of the Liar
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): This is combination a lot of Guardians are chasing for Huntere melee builds. You can use any grenade, but Grapple grenade with the melee follow-up also counts to proc Caliban's. For the melee ability, the Threaded Spike melee can chain multiple ignitions, or a more traditional Combination Blow is a natual pairing to the Liar intrinsic side. Then Gambler's Dodge near enemies to get your melee back and repeat until the room's clear. The Caliban ignitions will stun Overload champions, but as you'll be up close, you might need to think about a bit of invisibility, damage resistance and/or healing somewhere else in your subclass setup and armour mods. So maybe try Stylish Executioner and Winter's Shroud Aspects (dodge applies slow nearby, and then killing slowed enemies makes you invisible), and then Facets of Sacrifice, Courage, Dawn, Protection, and Ruin - Protection gives you +30% DR in a crowd, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant (so you can pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant, you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions.

// Relatavism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of Galinor, Spirit of the Star Eater
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): If you'd like an exotic cloak combination that just passively makes every super better without really having to think about it, this is the one to use. or end-game use, maybe Deadfall Tether and Silence and Squall work best, as you're not so exposed to return fire while they're active. Spirit of Galinor returns super energy on hits and final blows, while Spirit of the Star Eater boosts super damage by up to 70% at six stacks, just by picking up orbs. It's that easy! Aspects and Fragments, will largely depend on your super, and neutral game buildcrafting goals, so there's not really any specific recommendations.

// Relatavism (first-choice PvE)
// (Spirit of Renewal, Spirit of Inmost Light), Spirit of the Cyrtarachne)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): There's two possible ways to go - Renewal and Cyrtarachne (a genus of orb-weaver spiders, seeing as you're asking) or Inmost Light and Cyrtarachne. Throwing the grenade in either case grants Woven Mail for -45% damage reduction. With the first option, you're restricted to Duskfield Grenades, but they are good with the slowing and freezing effective on Overload and Unstoppable Champions, plus Renewal's effect of reducing damage output from enemies by -50% and providing allies with Frost Armour. With Spirit of Inmost Light, you can use any grenade (although Duskfield is still very good) and rely on the short cooldown of your dodge and Gambler's Dodge with Combination Blow to keep the fast ability regeneration going. The Facet of Balance, in particular, is good here to boost grenade energy on rapid darkness kills.

// Stoicism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of Inmost Light, Spirit of Synthoceps
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): At the time of writing, Consecration Aspect builds are very strong, and this is the ideal intrinsic perk combination to take advantage of its room-clearing ability, and Unstoppable Champion stopping power through ignitions. Synthoceps boosts melee damage by 200% while in CQC with 3 or more enemies, while Inmost Light helps recover your melee energy as fast as possible by using your other abilities. Choose Frenzied Blade to start with three charges, Thruster or Rally Barricade for the shortest cooldown, and a Grapple grenade for another source of darkness debuff, and you can pair that with a Drengr's Lash or Diamond Lance Aspect for even more sources of darkness debuffs. For fragments, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Ruin play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Consecration), Protection gives you +30% DR in a crowd, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant (so you can pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant, you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions.

// Stoicism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of the Eternal Warrior, Spirit of Star Eater
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): Titans have typically struggled to keep up with other subclasses during boss damage phases in the past, but this combination of passive intrinsic perks should help level the playing field. Star Eater boosts super damage by +70% at six stacks, while Eternal Warrier grants four stacks of a matching weapon surge, boosting damage by +25% for 30s - this will stack with weapon boosts like Bait and Switch, Explosive Light and Firing Line. If you use the void Twilight Arsenal super for quick burst damage at the start of a DPS phase, you can combine that with your void DPS weapon of choice. Aspects and Fragments will largely depend on your neutral game buildcrafting goals, so there's not really any specific recommendations.

// Stoicism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of Severance, (Spirit of Contact, Spirit of Synthoceps)
// Spirit of Inmost Light, Spirit of Contact
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): If you're a Titan and like punching thingsâ€¦ (well, why else would you play Titan?), then this is a fun set of intrinsic trait combinations to play with that add additional AoE damage, and either Jolting (excellent for disrupting Overload Champions) with Contact or +200% melee damage with Synthoceps. Grapple grenades supply darkness debuffs by suspending targets and you could choose Thrust or Rally Barricade for a class ability with a short cooldown. Drengr's Lash and Diamond Lance Aspect serve as additional sources of darkness debuffs. For fragments, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Blessing play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Jolt), Protection gives you +30% DR in a crowd, Blessing starts health regeneration on melee kills, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant (so you can pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), and Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more jolt damage against slowed/suspended enemies).

// Stoicism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of the Abeyant, Spirit of the Horn
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): More for fun than anything else, this intrinsic perk pairing sends out a suspending wave (which will stun an Unstoppable champion), and and solar scorching blast when casting your barricade (it down't trigger properly using Thrust, unfortunately). Neither is particulary strong in an endgame environment on their own, so probably not for a GM Nightfall. You'll obviously need to use the Drengr's Lash Aspect, but the other is dealer's choice and Fragments of Hope, Courage, Protection and Purpose play well - picking up orbs applies a beneficial subclass verb to yourself with Purpose, and while that verb is active Hope boosts the barricade ability recharge rate on kills; Protection gives you +30% DR in a crowd and Courage boosts the scorch damage on a suspended enemy.

// Solipsism (first-choice PvE)
// Spirit of Apotheosis, (Spirit of Star Eater, Spirit of Harmony)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 14 August 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SKpRAnTC5gulAjyj6aed1?si=ed2635f4a03a4676) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-Boss / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): A decent all-purpose pairing - either overcharge your super with up to +70% damage at six stacks with Star Eater for boss fights or get your super faster with a weapon matching your super's energy type with Harmony while add-clearing, and then come out of the super with an ability to spam grenades and melees. Maybe one to use with a full set of Pale Heart weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin trait, for faster super recharge - with two excellent strand weapons in the set, in The Call and Pro Memoria, that would pair well with the Needlestorm super. Aspects and Fragments, will largely depend on your super, and neutral game buildcrafting goals, so there's not really any specific recommendations.
