title:PvE Podcast 165 Season 28 Crucible weapons
description:Renegades expansion Lawless season - Crucible, Competitive and Trials of Osiris weapons, discussed in the 17 February 2026 @PodvsEnemies podcast episode 165 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Pw9mthT7HFkXAZ17BtVmH?si=469a473fddd346cb)

// Corundum Hammer - PvE Minor god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), (Shoot to Loot), (Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add clearing in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Corundum Hammer is an adaptive hand cannon, which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic being a good quality of life subfamily, even if damage output isn't great. The frame offers no intrinsic bonuses as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are a bit random by comparison with other adaptive HCs - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1323862250 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. First priority with the barrel perk is Recoil Direction, and then with the magazine perk look for something that helps ammo, reload speed or both. For end-game use, this provides an Strand alternative for anyone holding onto Vulpecula with the trait perk pairing of Shoot to Loot to pick up remote ammo bricks or orbs from safety by shooting them, which also reloads all your weapons from reserves and Explosive Payload which boosts bodyshot damage by ×1.15 and crit damage by ×1.1 with increased stagger, and inflicts AoE damage on enemies within 3m - this also expands the pickup radius of Shoot to Loot. There's a choice of Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s, or Fleet Footed which stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness for a refreshable 5s (6s enhanced). If you're interested, Corundum is a very hard, crystalline mineral composed of aluminum oxide, the third-hardest mineral after diamond and moissanite and the basis for rubies and sapphires when of gemstone quality. Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

First priority with the barrel perk is Recoil Direction, and then with the magazine perk look for something that helps ammo, reload speed or both. This provides an interesting roll pairing two trait perks that proc on crit kills - Firefly procs a 4m AoE solar explosion, plus +50 Reload Speed for 6s in the first trait perk column, which you can match with Tear which spreads ~4m AoE Sever to reduce damage output to ×0.6 from enemies affected, to synergise with Strand builds. There's a choice of Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s, or Fleet Footed which stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness for a refreshable 5s (6s enhanced).

// Mos Athanor IV - PvE Minor god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Destabilizing Rounds), (Demoralize)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Minor PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for controlling groups of Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly for Void builds. Mos Athenor IV is an aggressive frame hand cannon, which are rated D-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having an surprisingly alright profile but poor QoL and low RPM making this less usable. The frame offers high damage and high recoil, and is optimised for long-distance shooting as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with other precision autos - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/4118334987 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base battery size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 23. The recoil isn't too difficult to control, with the lower fire rate, so look to improve Handling with the barrel perk. You have the choice of combat effect magazine perks, or look for something that improves Reload Speed. For void synergy, and to make short work of add mobs, there's the trait perk pairing of Destabilizing Rounds to spread Volatility on a kill in a 6.5m radius and provide Volatile Rounds for 4.5s (5.25s when enhanced), and Demoralize to also spread a ~4m AoE cloud of Weaken to nearby enemies for a ×1.15 boost to damage for your fireteam for 3s (5s when enhanced) on a crit kill, which should see everything disappear in a purple fog. There's a choice of Wild Card for the chance of Telesto-like "Experimental Submunitions" dropping on a kill - the number depends on the enemy tier - that last up to 10.5s and explode on contact or proximity to an enemy or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s.

// The Martlet - PvE Minor god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), (Repulsor Brace, Loose Change), (Withering Gaze)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Minor PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for single-target damage against tougher enemies in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly for Void builds. The Martlet is a lightweight pulse rifle, which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic being largely interchangeable with other pulses. The frame offers +20 to the hidden Mobility stat and ×1.0625 base movement speed as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are excellent by comparison with other lightweight pulses - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/877384 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. The 65 recoil is vertical but loose, so you can tighten that with the barrel perk. With the magazine perk, look for something that improves mag size, Reload Speed or both. For Void synergy and to help bring down tougher enemies in end-game content, there's the pairing of Repulsor Brace which provides a ×0.5 damage resisting Void overshield for 8s (10s when enhanced) after killing a void-debuffed enemy - the duration's boosted by ×1.5 with Echo of Persistence - and Withering Gaze to apply the Void Weaken debuff to targets after ADS-ing for 1.4s (1.3s enhanced) for ×1.15 damage for a refreshable 6s for your fireteam, but if the stronger ×1.3 weaken has been applied from Tractor Cannon or Shadowshot, a proc will reapply at the higher value, which can be very handy in boss damage phases when used as part of a weapon rotation. Alternatively, Loose Change helps after you apply Weaken with Withering Gaze, providing +50 Reload Speed +20 Aim Assist and ×1.2 ADS movement speed for 9s (10s enhanced). There's a choice of Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s, or Fleet Footed which stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness for a refreshable 5s (6s enhanced). If you're interested, a Martlet is a mythical bird used in heraldry that, in tradition, never lands from birth to death.

// The Immortal - PvE Minor god 1
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Threat Detector, Attrition Orbs), (Master of Arms)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add clearing in general at-level or better content. The reprised Immortal is an aggressive SMG, which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having similar damage output to adaptives but lower RPM and QoL. The frame offers high damage and high recoil as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are best in class by comparison with other aggressive SMGs - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2872063099 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Even though the range is quite compressed, you can afford to boost it a little with the barrel perk, or improve Handling further. There are the combat effect mags available, which are always useful, or use the magazine perk to improve Reload Speed. For a general add-clearing roll, in the first trait perk column, Threat Detector procs per enemy within 15m up to ×2 stacks, with two stacks providing +40 Stability, +60 Reload Speed with a ×0.81 animation scalar and +100 Handling (+44, +64 and +100 respectively, when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after ~23 hits within 5s of each other, to proc armour mods. Then, in the second column for damage, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active. There's a choice of Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s, or Fleet Footed which stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness for a refreshable 5s (6s enhanced). Probably more relevant to PvE is Field-Tested which starts subtly but if you can stay alive to get kills, you'll start to feel the gunfeel stat boosts as you get to the higher stacks. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

// The Immortal - PvE Minor god 2
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Hatchling, Slice), (Master of Arms, Demolitionist)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add clearing in general at-level or better content, particularly with Strand builds. The reprised Immortal is an aggressive SMG, which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having similar damage output to adaptives but lower RPM and QoL. The frame offers high damage and high recoil as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are best in class by comparison with other aggressive SMGs - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2872063099 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Even though the range is quite compressed, you can afford to boost it a little with the barrel perk, or improve Handling further. There are the combat effect mags available, which are always useful, or use the magazine perk to improve Reload Speed. For a general add-clearing roll to synergise eith Strand builds, in the first trait perk column, Hatchling spawns a Threadling on a crit kill or three crit hits within 3s of each other or Slice procs for 8s (9s when enhanced) after using a class ability, to Sever up to 5 enemies for ×0.6 damage reduction for a refreshable 10s. Then, in the second column for damage, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active or, for grenade energy, Demolitionist generates chunk grenade ability energy on kills and an instant magazine refill on grenade use. There's a choice of Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s, or Fleet Footed which stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness for a refreshable 5s (6s enhanced). Probably more relevant to PvE is Field-Tested which starts subtly but if you can stay alive to get kills, you'll start to feel the gunfeel stat boosts as you get to the higher stacks. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for single-target damage against tougher enemies in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Peculiar Charm is the first of a new aggressive burst SMG subfamily, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having surprisingly solid performance for an SMG. The frame fires a four-round burst as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. As this is first in class, there's not really anything to compare against - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3620277039 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance when the formulas are calculated. By comparison with aggressive SMGs, the Handling is a bit low so you might look to boost that with the barrel perk, or look to one that helps with recoil control to hit crits. With the magazine perk, look for more bullets in the mag, faster reloads or a combination of both. In end-game content, there are passive trait perks like Attrition Orbs in the first column to spawn a power orb after ~20 hits within 5s of each other to proc armour mods or Shoot to Loot to pick up remote ammo bricks or orbs from safety by shooting them, also reloading all your weapons from reserves at the same time. In the second column, Kinetic Tremors emits three 6m AoE kinetic shockwaves after 14 hits (13 when enhanced) within 3s of each other, which are treated as weapon damage and inherit damage boosts so also proc weapon effects like Attrition Orbs' orb generation or picking up ammo bricks and power orbs with Shoot to Loot. Instead of origin traits there are stocks to choose from - look for something that boosts the gunfeel stats you like best, preferably without any malus. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Peculiar Charm - PvE Minor god 2
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Attrition Orbs, Shoot to Loot), (Master of Arms)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clearing in general at-level content. Peculiar Charm is the first of a new aggressive burst SMG subfamily, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having surprisingly solid performance for an SMG. The frame fires a four-round burst as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. As this is first in class, there's not really anything to compare against - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3620277039 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance when the formulas are calculated. By comparison with aggressive SMGs, the Handling is a bit low so you might look to boost that with the barrel perk, or look to one that helps with recoil control to hit crits. With the magazine perk, look for more bullets in the mag, faster reloads or a combination of both. For general add clearing, there are trait perks like Attrition Orbs in the first column to spawn a power orb after ~20 hits within 5s of each other to proc armour mods or Shoot to Loot to pick up remote ammo bricks or orbs by shooting them, also reloading all your weapons from reserves at the same time. In the second column, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s when enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active. Instead of origin traits there are stocks to choose from - look for something that boosts the gunfeel stats you like best, preferably without any malus. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Peculiar Charm - PvE Minor good 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Rapid Hit, Stopping Power), (Kinetic Tremors, Master of Arms)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec M+KB Controller): Backup PvE roll for Minor add-clearing in general at-level content. Peculiar Charm is the first of a new aggressive burst SMG subfamily, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic having surprisingly solid performance for an SMG. The frame fires a four-round burst as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. As this is first in class, there's not really anything to compare against - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3620277039 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance when the formulas are calculated. By comparison with aggressive SMGs, the Handling is a bit low so you might look to boost that with the barrel perk, or look to one that helps with recoil control to hit crits. With the magazine perk, look for more bullets in the mag, faster reloads or a combination of both. For general add clearing, stacks up to ×5 on crit hits for up to +25 Stability and +60 Reload Speed with a ×0.92 animation multiplier for a refreshable 2s or Stopping Power provides increased stagger, and increased damage on low health enemies - ×1.07 when health is below 34%, ×1.1 when <23% and ×1.15 when <18%. In the second column, Kinetic Tremors emits three 6m AoE kinetic shockwaves after 14 hits (13 when enhanced) within 3s of each other, which are treated as weapon damage so inherit damage boosts from Stopping Power and also proc weapon effects. Alternatively, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s when enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active. Instead of origin traits there are stocks to choose from - look for something that boosts the gunfeel stats you like best, preferably without any malus. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec M+KB Controller

// Riptide - PvE Utility god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Enhanced Battery), (Overflow), (Chill Clip)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll to apply slow and freeze verbs in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly for Stasis builds. The reprised Riptide is a rapid-fire fusion rifle, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic being the best overall "easy fusion". The frame offers better total ammo reserves and a ×0.8 reload animation scalar when the battery is empty as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are good by comparison with other rapid-fire fusions - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1323862250 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base battery size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 23. With 9 bolts to control, look for a barrel perk that helps with recoil control together with any other stat that you want to bump. Enhanced Battery in the battery perk slot gets you to the maximum of 7 shots. To replace your non-Tiered Riptide and apply Slow and Freeze to enemies - particularly useful for those annoying Overload Champions - Overflow in the first trait perk column overflows the magazine by ×2 (×2.2 when enhanced), rounded up, on picking up an ammo brick. That pairs well in the second column with Chill Clip which applies +40 stacks of slow (freezing targets after 3 hits) within a 4m AoE for 4s on a hit - 8s with Whisper of Durance - with ammo in the top half of the base battery size. With an overflowed battery, that means 10 Chill Clip shots. There's a choice of Wild Card for the chance of Telesto-like "Experimental Submunitions" dropping on a kill - the number depends on the enemy tier - that last up to 10.5s and explode on contact or proximity to an enemy or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s. If you're lucky Accelerated Assault which passively reloads 10% of the battery and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within a 1.6s window. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a Charge Time mod or your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Riptide - PvE Boss god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Enhanced Battery), (Overflow, Auto-Loading Holster), (Controlled Burst)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage against bosses general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. The reprised Riptide is a rapid-fire fusion rifle, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic being the best overall "easy fusion". The frame offers better total ammo reserves and a ×0.8 reload animation scalar when the battery is empty as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are good by comparison with other rapid-fire fusions - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2297554989 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base battery size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 23. With 9 bolts to control, look for a barrel perk that helps with recoil control together with any other stat that you want to bump. Enhanced Battery in the battery perk slot gets you to the maximum of 7 shots. For boss damage as part of a weapon rotation, or burst damage in shorter damage windows, Overflow in the first trait perk column overflows the magazine by ×2 (×2.2 when enhanced), rounded up, on picking up an ammo brick or Auto-Loading Holster refills the magazine 3.5s (3.3s enhanced) after stowing. In the second column for damage, Controlled Burst reduces charge time to ×0.9 and boosts damage by ×1.2 for 2s (2.5s when enhanced) after a kill or landing all the bolts in a burst. There's a choice of Wild Card for the chance of Telesto-like "Experimental Submunitions" dropping on a kill - the number depends on the enemy tier - that last up to 10.5s and explode on contact or proximity to an enemy or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s.

// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling), (Appended Mag, Tactical Mag, Aloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Hatchling), (Rewind Rounds, Tear)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for add control in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Strand builds. Qua Vinctus is a high-impact LMG, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic higher total than other LMG subfamilies. The frame offers slower firing and higher damage, being more accurate when ADSing and stationary or moving slowly as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with other high-impact LMGs - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/337893613 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base magazine size is 44 (max 70) and total ammo is 23. Recoil should be fairly easy to control as this is slower firing, so you could concentrate on improving Handling with the barrel perk or, if you do need some extra control then look for help with Recoil Direction or extra Stability. For the magazine perk, look to improve mag size or Reload Speed, or both. For add-clearing and synergising with Strand builds, in the first trait perk column, Hatchling spawns a Strand Threadling on a crit kill or three crit hits within 3s of each other and then in the second, Tear spreads ~4m AoE Strand Sever on a crit kill to reduce damage output to ×0.6 from enemies affected. Alternatively, it's unusual to see Rewind Rounds in the second column, but you might consider it - it refills 60% of hits landed (70% when enhanced) from reserves when the magazine empties. There's a choice of Wild Card for the chance of Telesto-like "Experimental Submunitions" dropping on a kill - the number depends on the enemy tier - that last up to 10.5s and explode on contact or proximity to an enemy or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s. If you're lucky Accelerated Assault which passively reloads 10% of the battery and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within a 1.6s window. If you're interested, Qua Vinctus is a Latin phrase that translates to approximately "as bound" or "in the capacity of someone who is bound".

// Qua Vinctus IV - PvE Minor god 2
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling), (Appended Mag, Tactical Mag, Aloy Mag, Flared Magwell), (Hatchling), (Rewind Rounds, Tear)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for add control in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Strand builds. Qua Vinctus is a high-impact LMG, which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic higher total than other LMG subfamilies. The frame offers slower firing and higher damage, being more accurate when ADSing and stationary or moving slowly as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with other high-impact LMGs - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/4176551594 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base magazine size is 44 (max 70) and total ammo is 23. Recoil should be fairly easy to control as this is slower firing, so you could concentrate on improving Handling with the barrel perk or, if you do need some extra control then look for help with Recoil Direction or extra Stability. For the magazine perk, look to improve mag size or Reload Speed, or both. For add-clearing and synergising with Strand builds, in the first trait perk column, Hatchling spawns a Strand Threadling on a crit kill or three crit hits within 3s of each other and then in the second, Tear spreads ~4m AoE Strand Sever on a crit kill to reduce damage output to ×0.6 from enemies affected. Alternatively, it's unusual to see Rewind Rounds in the second column, but you might consider it - it refills 60% of hits landed (70% when enhanced) from reserves when the magazine empties. There's a choice of Wild Card for the chance of Telesto-like "Experimental Submunitions" dropping on a kill - the number depends on the enemy tier - that last up to 10.5s and explode on contact or proximity to an enemy or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s. If you're lucky Accelerated Assault which passively reloads 10% of the battery and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within a 1.6s window. If you're interested, Qua Vinctus is a Latin phrase that translates to approximately "as bound" or "in the capacity of someone who is bound". Recommended MW: Handling, with a your preferred choice of mod to boost weapon stats, ammo generation, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller
