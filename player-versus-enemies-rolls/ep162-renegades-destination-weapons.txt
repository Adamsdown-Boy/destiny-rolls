title:PvE Podcast 162 Renegades destination weapons
description:Renegades expansion destination weapons with the Air Cooled and Accelerated Assault origin traits, discussed in the 13 January 2026 @PodvsEnemies podcast episode 162 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4CRaOtRVyJfEatcfPmqVHh?si=c5c5a03af46d47b3)

// Modified B-7 Pistol - PvE Minor god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink), (Rimestealer), (Headstone, Crystalline Corpsebloom)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in general at-level or better content, particularly on Stasis builds. The Modified B-7 Pistol is a Dynamic Heat hand cannon which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are good by comparison with precision hand cannons, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1872906663 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. The Handling is on the low side, so use the barrel perk to boost that - on M+KB Fluted Barrel is the top pick, or on controller, the +30 Recoil Direction from Arrowhead Brake is useful. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For Stasis synergy, there's the trait perk pairing of Rimestealer to generate a stack (2 stacks when enhanced) of Frost Armor on shattering a Stasis crystal or killing a frozen enemy together with either Headstone to generate a Stasis crystal on a crit kill, which can be shattered for AoE damage and to proc stasis ability effects, or Crystalline Corpsebloom which procs on a kill to provide a 4s buff - kills with the buff active generate a stasis seeker which travels 3m before spawning a medium Stasis crystal (large when enhanced) to shatter for AoE damage. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled on the MW-20 Bryar pistol used by Cassian Andor (and the K-16 Bryar that inspired that, used by Kyle Katarn in Dark Forces). Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

For the trait perks, Demolitionist is always handy to generate chunk grenade ability energy on kills, and an instant heat vent on grenade use, while Headstone generates a Stasis crystal on a crit kill - shattering the crystal counts as weapon damage, so any AoE kills count towards Demolitionist as well as proccing stasis ability effects.

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add group control in general at-level or better content. The Modified B-7 Pistol is a Dynamic Heat hand cannon which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium.

For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. This is a roll to tuck away for a future correction of a probably unintended damage nerf - in the first trait perk column, Demolitionist to generate chunk grenade ability energy on kills, and an instant heat vent on grenade use, or Firefly for a 4m AoE solar explosion plus +50 Reload Speed for 6s after a crit kill. Alternatively, Rapid Hit or Keep Away both passively improve gunfeel. Pair one of those with Thermal Atomization in the second column to boost damage by between ×1.08 and ×1.14 as heat increases from 50% to 100%, and then proc a 7.5m AoE Stasis explosion on a kill - except the AoE damage is terrible, at only 1/4 of an SMG-generated explosion which feels like it must be a decimal point in the wrong place. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting.

// Modified B-7 Pistol - PvE Minor god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink), (Rimestealer), (Headstone, Crystalline Corpsebloom)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in general at-level or better content, particularly on Stasis builds. The Modified B-7 Pistol is a Dynamic Heat hand cannon which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are good by comparison with precision hand cannons, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1872906663 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. The Handling is on the low side, so use the barrel perk to boost that - on M+KB Fluted Barrel is the top pick, or on controller, the +30 Recoil Direction from Arrowhead Brake is useful. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For Stasis synergy, there's the trait perk pairing of Rimestealer to generate a stack (2 stacks when enhanced) of Frost Armor on shattering a Stasis crystal or killing a frozen enemy together with either Headstone to generate a Stasis crystal on a crit kill, which can be shattered for AoE damage and to proc stasis ability effects, or Crystalline Corpsebloom which procs on a kill to provide a 4s buff - kills with the buff active generate a stasis seeker which travels 3m before spawning a medium Stasis crystal (large when enhanced) to shatter for AoE damage. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s.

// Modified B-7 Pistol - PvE Minor god 2
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink), (Firefly), (Headstone)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add group control in general at-level or better content, particularly on Stasis builds. The Modified B-7 Pistol is a Dynamic Heat hand cannon which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are good by comparison with precision hand cannons, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1872906663 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. The Handling is on the low side, so use the barrel perk to boost that - on M+KB Fluted Barrel is the top pick, or on controller, the +30 Recoil Direction from Arrowhead Brake is useful. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For Stasis synergy, there's the trait perk pairing of Firefly to procs a 4m AoE solar explosion, plus +50 Reload Speed for 6s after a crit kill together with which will shatter the Stasis Crystal generated by Headstone on a crit kill, for additional AoE damage to proc stasis ability effects. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled on the MW-20 Bryar pistol used by Cassian Andor (and the K-16 Bryar that inspired that, used by Kyle Katarn in Dark Forces).

This is a roll to tuck away for a future correction of a probably unintended damage nerf - in the first trait perk column, Demolitionist to generate chunk grenade ability energy on kills, and an instant heat vent on grenade use, or Firefly for a 4m AoE solar explosion plus +50 Reload Speed for 6s after a crit kill. Alternatively, Rapid Hit or Keep Away both passively improve gunfeel. Pair one of those with Thermal Atomization in the second column to boost damage by between ×1.08 and ×1.14 as heat increases from 50% to 100%, and then proc a 7.5m AoE Stasis explosion on a kill - except the AoE damage is terrible, at only 1/4 of an SMG-generated explosion which feels like it must be a decimal point in the wrong place.

For Strand synergy and add group control, there trait perk pairings that all proc on crit kills - Firefly procs a 4m AoE solar explosion, plus +50 Reload Speed for 6s in the first trait perk column, which you can match with Tear to spreads ~4m AoE sever to reduce damage output to ×0.6 from enemies affected - Firefly widens the Tear AoE further - or Hatchling spawns a Threadling also on a crit kill or on three crit hits within 3s of each other.

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in general at-level or better content, particularly on Strand builds. All Or Nothing is a Dynamic Heat pulse rifle which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with rapid fire pulses, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3984776322 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. The Handling is on the low side, so use the barrel perk to boost that - although you might want a little extra recoil control or Stability. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For Strand synergy, there's the trait perk pairing of Slice in the first column which procs for 8s (9s when enhanced) after using a class ability, to Sever enemies for ×0.6 damage reduction for a refreshable 10s on up to 5 targets. In the second column, Hatchling spawns a Threadling on a crit kill or on three crit hits within 3s of each other. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled on the EE-3 Carbine rifle used by Mandalorian bounty hunter Boba Fett.

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add group control in general at-level or better content, particularly on Void builds. Compact Defender is a Dynamic Heat pulse rifle which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight sidearms, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2819552809 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. With any fast firing weapon, improving recoil control can be useful, but otherwise looks for Handling on M+KB, and maybe extra Stability on controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For Void synergy, the tried and trusted trait perk combination of Destabilizing Rounds, which spreads Volatility on a kill in a 6.5m radius and provides Volatile Rounds for 4.5s (5.25s when enhanced) to clear Minor add groups, and Repulsor Brace - provides a ×0.5 damage resisting Void overshield for 8s (10s when enhanced) after killing a void-debuffed enemy. With this being a CQC primary, the overshield can be very useful for tanking damage. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled after the Defender sporting blaster pistol used by Princess Leia Organa in the opening scenes of Star Wars: A New Hope.

// Compact Defender - PvE Minor god 2
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Particle Repeater,), (Destabilizing Rounds), (Frenzy)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add group control in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Void builds. Compact Defender is a Dynamic Heat pulse rifle which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight sidearms, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2819552809 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. With any fast firing weapon, improving recoil control can be useful, but otherwise looks for Handling on M+KB, and maybe extra Stability on controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For add clearing and void synergy, there's the double damage perk combination of Destabilizing Rounds, which spreads Volatility on a kill in a 6.5m radius and provides Volatile Rounds for 4.5s (5.25s when enhanced) to clear Minor add groups, and and Frenzy which after being in combat for 12s - that's dealing or taking damage - boosts Handling and Reload Speed by +100 and boosts damage by ×1.15 for a refreshable 7.2s - that damage boost applies to the volatility explosions too, as they count as weapon damage. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled after the Defender sporting blaster pistol used by Princess Leia Organa in the opening scenes of Star Wars: A New Hope. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Compact Defender - PvE Minor god 3
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Particle Repeater,), (Destabilizing Rounds), (Thermal Atomization)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Minor add group control in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Void builds. Compact Defender is a Dynamic Heat pulse rifle which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight sidearms, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2659286158 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. With any fast firing weapon, improving recoil control can be useful, but otherwise looks for Handling on M+KB, and maybe extra Stability on controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For add clearing and void synergy, there's the double damage perk combination of Destabilizing Rounds, which spreads Volatility on a kill in a 6.5m radius and provides Volatile Rounds for 4.5s (5.25s when enhanced) to clear Minor add groups, and Thermal Atomization to boost damage by between ×1.08 and ×1.14 as heat increases from 50% to 100%, and then proc a 7.5m AoE Void explosion on a kill, spreading volatility even further. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled after the Defender sporting blaster pistol used by Princess Leia Organa in the opening scenes of Star Wars: A New Hope. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Stasis subclasses. The M-17 "Fast Talker" is a Balanced Heat SMG which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually vent at >87.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight SMGs, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1419158093 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Use the barrel perk to boost your preferred weapon stats - although remember range is very compressed on SMGs and you might want a little extra recoil control or Stability on a controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability, or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For an all-purpose SMG, in the first trait perk column Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 20-22 hits, depending on the Battery perk, within 5s of each other to proc armour mods, while in the second Target Lock stacks up to 5 times on repeated hits within 0.2s of each other for up to ×1.4 damage at 110.33% of base magazine capacity - so should proc if you can time your manual vent correctly. This, particularly with Titan Peacekeepers, should be a good primary to use in longer boss DPS phases to generate super energy, especially if you get the rare Accelerated Assault origin trait. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s.

// (Smallbore, Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Particle Repeater), (Attrition Orbs, Demolitionist), (Crystalline Corpsebloom)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in general at-level or better content. The M-17 "Fast Talker" is a Balanced Heat SMG which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually vent at >87.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight SMGs, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1419158093 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Use the barrel perk to boost your preferred weapon stats - although remember range is very compressed on SMGs - but you might want a little extra recoil control or Stability on a controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability, or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. In the first trait perk column Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 20-22 hits, depending on the Battery perk, within 5s of each other to proc armour mods, or Demolitionist is always handy to generate chunk grenade ability energy on kills, and an instant heat vent on grenade use. For a damage perk in the second column, there's the heat-weapon Thermal Atomization, which boosts damage by between ×1.08 and ×1.14 as heat increases from 50% to 100%, and then procs a 7.5m AoE Stasis explosion on a kill, or the more traditional options of Master of Arms or Sword logic to boost damage after a kill. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled after the DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System used by Clone Commandos during the Clone Wars. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Endgame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// M-17 "Fast Talker" - PvE Minor god 1
// (Smallbore, Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Particle Repeater), (Attrition Orbs), (Target Lock)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll against Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with Stasis subclasses. The M-17 "Fast Talker" is a Balanced Heat SMG which are rated C-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually vent at >87.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The stats are decent by comparison with lightweight SMGs, which are the closest comparators - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2770035786 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Use the barrel perk to boost your preferred weapon stats - although remember range is very compressed on SMGs and you might want a little extra recoil control or Stability on a controller. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability, or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. For an all-purpose SMG, in the first trait perk column Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 20-22 hits, depending on the Battery perk, within 5s of each other to proc armour mods, while in the second Target Lock stacks up to 5 times on repeated hits within 0.2s of each other for up to ×1.4 damage at 110.33% of base magazine capacity - so should proc if you can time your manual vent correctly. This, particularly with Titan Peacekeepers, should be a good primary to use in longer boss DPS phases to generate super energy, especially if you get the rare Accelerated Assault origin trait. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled after the DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System used by Clone Commandos during the Clone Wars. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Endgame PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Uncivil Discourse - PvE Major god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Extended Barrel), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Enhanced Heatsink), (Air Trigger, Keep Away, Outlaw), (Jolting Feedback, Frenzy, Thermal Atomization, Precision Instrument, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Banes, Majors, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Uncivil Discourse is the first of a new subfamily of special ammo Dynamic Heat hand cannons which are rated A-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The there's nothing to really compare this against, but you can see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3146657389 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. You might find you need a little help with the recoil control from the barrel perk, although extra Handling is also nice. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. There plenty of good rolls available for burst damage, or backup boss damage - Air Trigger, mostly for the +20 Ammo Generation making double special weapon loadouts easier to maintain, but also for the ability to jump reload is probably the top first trait perk column park, but anything that improves manual vent speed is worth considering. In the second column, Jolting Feedback applies Jolt after 7 hits (6 when enhanced and 4 when amplified) to tougher enemies who can survive the weapon damage, triggering chain lightning on further hits for both target and AoE damage, but Frenzy's here, as is Precision Instrument and Desperate Measures for builds that spam melee or grenade abilities. Thermal Atomization is more of a "one for the Vault just in case they fix the explosion damage" choice. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled on the DL-44 blaster pistol used by Han Solo. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Uncivil Discourse - PvE Major god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Extended Barrel), (Overclocked Heatsink, Light Heatsink, Tactical Heatsink, Enhanced Heatsink), (Air Trigger, Keep Away, Outlaw), (Jolting Feedback, Frenzy, Thermal Atomization, Precision Instrument, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Banes, Majors, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Uncivil Discourse is the first of a new subfamily of special ammo Dynamic Heat hand cannons which are rated A-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing an intrinsic ×1.15 damage boost against red-bar enemies and ×1.325 against orange and yellow bars and vehicles, plus a ×0.5 heat generation if you manually cancel a vent animation at <12.5% of maximum heat, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The there's nothing to really compare this against, but you can see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2462965802 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. You might find you need a little help with the recoil control from the barrel perk, although extra Handling is also nice. For the battery perk, Overclocked Heatsink provides free ×1.02 damage for a slightly slower vent speed - not a problem if you manually reload anyway - Particle Repeater helps Stability or Light Heatsink or Tactical Heatsink improve gunfeel. There plenty of good rolls available for burst damage, or backup boss damage - Air Trigger, mostly for the +20 Ammo Generation making double special weapon loadouts easier to maintain, but also for the ability to jump reload is probably the top first trait perk column park, but anything that improves manual vent speed is worth considering. In the second column, Jolting Feedback applies Jolt after 7 hits (6 when enhanced and 4 when amplified) to tougher enemies who can survive the weapon damage, triggering chain lightning on further hits for both target and AoE damage, but Frenzy's here, as is Precision Instrument and Desperate Measures for builds that spam melee or grenade abilities. Thermal Atomization is more of a "one for the Vault just in case they fix the explosion damage" choice. For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's modelled on the DL-44 blaster pistol used by Han Solo. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Refurbished A499 - PvE Boss god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag), (Snapshot Sights), (Auto-Loading Holster)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Boss DPS rotations in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Uncivil Discourse is the first of a new subfamily of heavy ammo Disruption Weapon sniper rifles which are rated A-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing a high-damage single shot that disintegrates enemies on kills, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The there's nothing to really compare this against, but you can see https://d2foundry.gg/w/593808239 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. With this being a sniper, and single shot, the only weapon stats that have an impact are Handling and Reload Speed, so look for barrel and mag perks that help. The trait perk pool for PvE is, frankly, a bit weird, but this is still worth considering for boss damage. In the first trait perk column there's nothing much that helps with boss damage phases - the most useful are probably Snapshot Sights for faster ADS speed, or No Distractions for ×0.65 reduction in flinch for ADSing for 1s (0.9s when enhanced). Then, in the second column, Aggregate Charge provides a stack for each different elemental debuff up to ×3 stacks to boost damage by up to ×1.3 (×1.33 when enhanced), with each stack lasting as long as the debuff is active. Alternatively, Auto-Loading Holster could work as part of a special weapon Bait and Switch rotation, or Box Breathing provides a ×1.3 damage boost after ADSing for 1.5s (1.4s enhanced). For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's after the Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster used by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Refurbished A499 - PvE Boss god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag), (Snapshot Sights), (Auto-Loading Holster)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for Boss DPS rotations in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Uncivil Discourse is the first of a new subfamily of heavy ammo Disruption Weapon sniper rifles which are rated A-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, providing a high-damage single shot that disintegrates enemies on kills, as per the https://www.destiny2.science/ Destiny Data Compendium. The there's nothing to really compare this against, but you can see https://d2foundry.gg/w/593808239 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. With this being a sniper, and single shot, the only weapon stats that have an impact are Handling and Reload Speed, so look for barrel and mag perks that help. The trait perk pool for PvE is, frankly, a bit weird, but this is still worth considering for boss damage. In the first trait perk column there's nothing much that helps with boss damage phases - the most useful are probably Snapshot Sights for faster ADS speed, or No Distractions for ×0.65 reduction in flinch for ADSing for 1s (0.9s when enhanced). Then, in the second column, Aggregate Charge provides a stack for each different elemental debuff up to ×3 stacks to boost damage by up to ×1.3 (×1.33 when enhanced), with each stack lasting as long as the debuff is active. Alternatively, Auto-Loading Holster could work as part of a special weapon Bait and Switch rotation, or Box Breathing provides a ×1.3 damage boost after ADSing for 1.5s (1.4s enhanced). For the Origin Trait Air-Cooled Core improves handling and ADS speed when heat is <10%, and boosts Vent Speed for 6s after sprinting. If you're very lucky you'll drop a weapon with the much better option of Accelerated Assault which passively reduces heat by 10% and boosts damage by ×1.05 for getting 3 hits within 1.6s. If you're interested, it's after the Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster used by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with your preferred choice of mod to boost heat generation, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller
