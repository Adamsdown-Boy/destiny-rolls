// Wilderflight (Adept) - PvE Bosses god 1

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 139 from 13 May 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0m6Sfdv88fNZmYm9A6PdVR?si=140d643338154357) with @ImpetusAlways @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for damage against Majors and Bosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. The original double-fire grenade launch Wilderflight returns with refreshed perks. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are in-band - d2foundry.gg calculates that 93 Velocity equates to 65.31m/s, 20 Stability is ×1.1000 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 43 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.42s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 32 Reload Speed is a 2.62s reload, Recoil Direction is 25, and Zoom is 13. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, total ammo is 21/22/23/23 (max 23). For barrel perk choices, look for something that improves Handling and Velocity. Then, for the magazine perk for damage against beefier enemies, Spike Grenades increases impact damage by ×1.1212, which is ×1.025 to overall damage. To pair with that, in the first trait perk column, Slideshot is the top pick as, as well as reloading it also procs Gravity Well to collect nearby ammo bricks. Auto-Loading Holster and Envious Arsenal are also very usable, but their reload effects don't work with Gravity Well. For damage, Bait and Switch in the second column boosts damage by ×1.3 for rotating through your weapons and hitting enemies. The Tex Balanced Stock is there if you like hipfiring, but the Gravity Well origin trait can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload, or using Slideshot or Demolitionist (other reload perks don't seem to work, unfortunately). Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller
