description:Season 27 Arms Week activity weapons with the Tenacity Origin Trait

// Trachinus - PvE Utility god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), (Lead From Gold), (Chill Clip)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for applying Stasis Slow and Freeze in general at-level or better content, particularly with a Stasis build. Trachinus is the first of a new slug shotgun subfamily - rapid-frime frames, which provides the usual deeper reserves and ×0.8 animation scalar when reloading from empty. It's also the new highest damage output subfamily for shotguns. There aren't really any peers to assess against, but the stats look good, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and mag perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3635232671 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base Magazine Size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 26. You can use the barrel perk to improve Handling and, at time of writing, Assault Mag is boosting RPM by +50 rather than the usual +5 - so have fun until someone deletes the errant "0". When that's corrected, a magazine perk that boosts mag size is probably the play. There aren't any reload options in the first trait perk column - although the Frame Intrinsic boosts reload from an empty mag and the Origin Trait can max out Reload Speed after 14 kills - so Lead from Gold to generate 25% of your special ammo reserves when you pick up heavy bricks looks good. In the second column, Chill Clip applies +60 stacks of slow per hit for 4s in the top half of the mag, so will freeze targets after 2 hits, synergising with Stasis builds and helping deal with Elites, Banes, Overload Champions, and Minibosses. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Veist Stinger which seems bugged at the time of writing, but which will provide probably ~4% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine when fixed. If you're interested, Trachinus is the taxonomic genus for weever fish, a type of venomous marine fish with a distinctive dorsal spine capable of inflicting painful stings, and comes from the Ancient Greek word τρᾱχύς (trachýs), meaning "rough". Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Alternatively, as you'll probably be in CQC while using it, Proximity Power stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. For a second column damage perk, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die.

There aren't really any peers to assess against, but the stats look good, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and mag perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2888021253 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base Magazine Size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 26. You can use the barrel perk to improve Handling and, at time of writing, Assault Mag is boosting RPM by +50 rather than the usual +5 - so have fun until someone deletes the errant "0". When that's corrected, a magazine perk that boosts mag size is probably the play. There aren't any reload options in the first trait perk column - although the Frame Intrinsic boosts reload from an empty mag and the Origin Trait can max out Reload Speed after 14 kills - so Lead from Gold to generate 25% of your special ammo reserves when you pick up heavy bricks looks good. Alternatively, as you'll probably be in CQC while using it, Proximity Power stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. For a second column damage perk, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Veist Stinger which seems bugged at the time of writing, but which will provide probably ~4% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine when fixed. If you're interested, Trachinus is the taxonomic genus for weever fish, a type of venomous marine fish with a distinctive dorsal spine capable of inflicting painful stings, and comes from the Ancient Greek word τρᾱχύς (trachýs), meaning "rough". Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Synanceia - PvE Utility god 1
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard, Burst Guard, Enduring Guard, Heavy Guard), (Sharp Harvest, Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Eager Edge)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for movement tech in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1823308496 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Normally we'd use the blade perk to maximise damage but, as this is an Eager Edge roll, the more ammo you have, the more sword lunges. And, for this particular roll, the guard perk doesn't really matter. The first trait perk column doesn't have anything that directly helps with Eager Edge but, if you're using this against adds it might as well do something useful. Sharp Harvest returns 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced), Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other - hits with the wave attack count towards the counter. Really, all of this is just the delivery system for a Edge of Fate featured Eager Edge sword that provides a ×1.8 increased grounded lunge and ×1.64 airborne lunge (×2 and ×1.8 when enhanced) for 3s after readying. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans. Recommended MW: Impact, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Synanceia - PvE Boss god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Surrounded, Elemental Honing, Burning Ambition)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Boss damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1823308496 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. Swords may not be the current meta for boss damage, but if you want to tuck away a roll just in case, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods. The second column damage perk is more situational - if there are 3+ adds within 15m, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to ×1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced). On a Transcendent subclass Elemental Honing grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. On a solar build, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you apply scorch with an ability initially, otherwise it'll take a few hits to apply +20 stacks, with +20 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For shorter damage windows, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that!

In the second column, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to 1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced) while within 15m of 3+ enemies which should help clear even the toughest adds. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

// Synanceia - PvE Utility god 1
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard, Burst Guard, Enduring Guard, Heavy Guard), (Sharp Harvest, Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Eager Edge)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for movement tech in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451288 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Normally we'd use the blade perk to maximise damage but, as this is an Eager Edge roll, the more ammo you have, the more sword lunges. And, for this particular roll, the guard perk doesn't really matter. The first trait perk column doesn't have anything that directly helps with Eager Edge but, if you're using this against adds it might as well do something useful. Sharp Harvest returns 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced), Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other - hits with the wave attack count towards the counter. Really, all of this is just the delivery system for a Edge of Fate featured Eager Edge sword that provides a ×1.8 increased grounded lunge and ×1.64 airborne lunge (×2 and ×1.8 when enhanced) for 3s after readying. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that!

// Synanceia - PvE Boss god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Surrounded, Elemental Honing, Burning Ambition)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Boss damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451288 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. Swords may not be the current meta for boss damage, but if you want to tuck away a roll just in case, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods. The second column damage perk is more situational - if there are 3+ adds within 15m, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to ×1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced). On a Transcendent subclass Elemental Honing grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. On a solar build, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you apply scorch with an ability initially, otherwise it'll take a few hits to apply +20 stacks, with +20 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For shorter damage windows, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die.

// Synanceia - PvE Minor god 2
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Attrition Orbs, Relentless Strikes, Sharp Harvest, Proximity Power), (Chain Reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Minor add group control damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451288 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. In the second column, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to 1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced) while within 15m of 3+ enemies which should help clear even the toughest adds. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans. Recommended MW: Impact, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Synanceia - PvE Utility god 1
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard, Burst Guard, Enduring Guard, Heavy Guard), (Sharp Harvest, Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Eager Edge)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for movement tech in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451289 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Normally we'd use the blade perk to maximise damage but, as this is an Eager Edge roll, the more ammo you have, the more sword lunges. And, for this particular roll, the guard perk doesn't really matter. The first trait perk column doesn't have anything that directly helps with Eager Edge but, if you're using this against adds it might as well do something useful. Sharp Harvest returns 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced), Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other - hits with the wave attack count towards the counter. Really, all of this is just the delivery system for a Edge of Fate featured Eager Edge sword that provides a ×1.8 increased grounded lunge and ×1.64 airborne lunge (×2 and ×1.8 when enhanced) for 3s after readying. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that!

// Synanceia - PvE Boss god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Surrounded, Elemental Honing, Burning Ambition)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Boss damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451289 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. Swords may not be the current meta for boss damage, but if you want to tuck away a roll just in case, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods. The second column damage perk is more situational - if there are 3+ adds within 15m, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to ×1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced). On a Transcendent subclass Elemental Honing grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. On a solar build, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you apply scorch with an ability initially, otherwise it'll take a few hits to apply +20 stacks, with +20 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For shorter damage windows, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea.

Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up.

You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die.

// Synanceia - PvE Minor god 2
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Attrition Orbs, Relentless Strikes, Sharp Harvest, Proximity Power), (Chain Reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Minor add group control damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451289 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. In the second column, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to 1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced) while within 15m of 3+ enemies which should help clear even the toughest adds. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans. Recommended MW: Impact, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Synanceia - PvE Utility god 1
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard, Burst Guard, Enduring Guard, Heavy Guard), (Sharp Harvest, Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Eager Edge)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for movement tech in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451290 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Normally we'd use the blade perk to maximise damage but, as this is an Eager Edge roll, the more ammo you have, the more sword lunges. And, for this particular roll, the guard perk doesn't really matter. The first trait perk column doesn't have anything that directly helps with Eager Edge but, if you're using this against adds it might as well do something useful. Sharp Harvest returns 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced), Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other - hits with the wave attack count towards the counter. Really, all of this is just the delivery system for a Edge of Fate featured Eager Edge sword that provides a ×1.8 increased grounded lunge and ×1.64 airborne lunge (×2 and ×1.8 when enhanced) for 3s after readying. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that!

// Synanceia - PvE Boss god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Surrounded, Elemental Honing, Burning Ambition)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Boss damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451290 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. Swords may not be the current meta for boss damage, but if you want to tuck away a roll just in case, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods. The second column damage perk is more situational - if there are 3+ adds within 15m, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to ×1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced). On a Transcendent subclass Elemental Honing grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. On a solar build, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you apply scorch with an ability initially, otherwise it'll take a few hits to apply +20 stacks, with +20 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For shorter damage windows, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

// Synanceia - PvE Utility god 1
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard, Burst Guard, Enduring Guard, Heavy Guard), (Sharp Harvest, Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Eager Edge)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for movement tech in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451291 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Normally we'd use the blade perk to maximise damage but, as this is an Eager Edge roll, the more ammo you have, the more sword lunges. And, for this particular roll, the guard perk doesn't really matter. The first trait perk column doesn't have anything that directly helps with Eager Edge but, if you're using this against adds it might as well do something useful. Sharp Harvest returns 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced), Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other - hits with the wave attack count towards the counter. Really, all of this is just the delivery system for a Edge of Fate featured Eager Edge sword that provides a ×1.8 increased grounded lunge and ×1.64 airborne lunge (×2 and ×1.8 when enhanced) for 3s after readying. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that!

// Synanceia - PvE Boss god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Relentless Strikes, Attrition Orbs), (Surrounded, Elemental Honing, Burning Ambition)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Boss damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451291 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. Swords may not be the current meta for boss damage, but if you want to tuck away a roll just in case, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy or Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods. The second column damage perk is more situational - if there are 3+ adds within 15m, Surrounded procs to boost damage by up to ×1.35 (×1.4175 when enhanced). On a Transcendent subclass Elemental Honing grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. On a solar build, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you apply scorch with an ability initially, otherwise it'll take a few hits to apply +20 stacks, with +20 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For shorter damage windows, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) on any elemental kill of the opposite type. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

// Synanceia - PvE Minor god 1
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard), (Attrition Orbs, Relentless Strikes, Sharp Harvest, Proximity Power), (Chain Reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Minor add group control damage in general at-level or better content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451291 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is (check in game*). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and and extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans. Recommended MW: Impact, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller
