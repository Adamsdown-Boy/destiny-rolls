@title:Season 23 Seasonal weapons
@description:Season of the Wish seasonal weapons, with the Dragon's Vengeance origin trait 

// Appetence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), Ionized Battery, Overflow, Killing Tally
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as your asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. Enhanced Battery increases the magazine without a reload penalty and, while Demolitionist on a trace rifle only returns the same grenade energy as a primary weapon, you should be getting enough kills to make the payoff worth it. Headstone generates Stasis crystals on crit kills, so lets you build into Stasis verbs and fragments - Whisper of Shards will further improve grenade recharge rates.

// Scatter Signal (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), Enhanced Battery, Overflow, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized, without any reload penalty. Slice, as the first trait column perk, when procced after using your class ability reduces outgoing damage from a target by 40% for 8s - increased by 50% with the Thread of Continuity fragment, whether or not they're immune - very useful in boss fights or as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. Controlled Burst as the second trait perk reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts.

// Supercluster (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), Slice, (Surrounded, Vorpal Weapon)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. Slice, as the first trait column perk, when procced after using your class ability reduces outgoing damage from a target by 40%, whether or not they're immune - very useful in boss fights or as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. For a damage boosting perk in the second trait slot, choose between Surrounded, if you're likely to be in CQC with extra adds, or Vorpal Weapon for a reliable 15% boost to damage against Majors and Bosses. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS, but you might want to keep one just in case, if you don't have a slug shotty already. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. If you're looking for a backup DPS weapon, then a reloading perk in the first trait column - Fourth Time's The Charm, Reconstruction, Threat Detector, or Lead For Gold for you ammo economy are all possible.

// Lethophobia (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Elastic String, Flexible String, Polymer String), Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), Successful Warm-Up, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor spec add clearing in general content. Shapeable. Lethophobia (or "fear of forgetting", seeing as you're asking) offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed as the Lightweight Frame bonus but, honestly the stats are poor and it's difficult to recommend for PvE. If you do want to try it out, the tactic with Bowstrong and Arrow perks is to reduce the draw time and improve accuracy. As the support perk in the first trait column, Successful Warm up improves draw time further, although you don't have to get a kill first, Explosive Head in the second as the signature perk is the reliable boost to damage and flinch that it always is. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

As the support perk in the first trait column, the new-for-season-23 Permeability works well with Golden Tricorn in the second as the signature perk to make the second damage stack, for +50% damage, attainable for any subclass you run. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

// Scalar Potential (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Permeability, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for bulkier Minor spec add clearing in general content. Shapeable. Scalar Potential has decent stats and a nice clean scope, but you're limited by a PvP trait perk pool. Arrowhead Brake is probably the best barrel perk, although you could imrpve handling or range if you can handle the recoil direction. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are then the pick of the mag perks. As the support perk in the first trait column, the new-for-season-23 Permeability works well with Golden Tricorn in the second as the signature perk to make the second damage stack, for +50% damage, attainable for any subclass you run. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for bulkier Minor spec add clearing in general content, particularly with an arc subclass. Shapeable. Scalar Potential has decent stats and a nice clean scope, but you're limited by a PvP trait perk pool. Arrowhead Brake is probably the best barrel perk, although you could imrpve handling or range if you can handle the recoil direction. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are then the pick of the mag perks. As the support perk in the first trait column, Enlightened Action boosts both handling and reload speed by 50 after five hits. In the second column as the signature perk, your arc abilities should make the second stack of Golden Tricorn easy to proc for +50% damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Doomed Petitioner (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake), Ionized Battery, Envious Assassin, (Precision Instrument, Surrounded)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a damage boosting (Boiss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller
