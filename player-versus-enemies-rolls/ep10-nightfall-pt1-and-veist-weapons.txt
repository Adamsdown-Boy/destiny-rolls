// Reed's Regret (PvE first choice roll)
// Any barrel, Ionized Battery, Triple Tap, Firing Line, Veist Stinger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 10. PvE first choice roll for Boss DPS. Barrel depends on your range/stability/handling preferences.

Even if you have it already, it's worth getting again for the Veist Stinger  Origin Trait which gives you a chance for reloads when dealing damage, so you might get through all your reserves in a single phase without reloading. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod.
