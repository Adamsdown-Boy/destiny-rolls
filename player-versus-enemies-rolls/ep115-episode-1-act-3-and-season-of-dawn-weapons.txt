@title:Episode 115 Episode 1 Act 3 and reprised Season of Dawn weapons
@description:What the title says

// Chronophage (first-choice PvE)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), (Enhanced Battery, Ionized Battery), Shoot to Loot, (One For All, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content. Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17. Stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Enhanced Battery boosts the total ammo to 456 (508/559/585) and Ionized Battery gets you to 461 (513/565/591). For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait perk is always useful to pick up ammo blocks and power orbs, but also reloads all your weapons, bypassing reload penalties. In the second, One for All provides an easy to proc a ×1.35 damage boost, or Desperate Measures is easy to proc while Transcendent with grenade and melee kills, for up to a ×1.3 boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? For anyone interested, the name's derived from Greek words "chronos" and "phage", literally meaning "time-eater" and is used colloquially in French to mean "time-consuming". Recommended MW: Stability (Controller) or Handling (M+KB), with a Quick Access Sling mod.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Speleologist's stats are on the low side, unfortunately, but there are still some very usable rolls. At base, 28 Range equates to 46.60m while ADS, 49 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.40s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 61 is a 4.59s reload. Total ammo is 514 total out of the box - which is pretty much the ceiling - increasing to 583/652/687 with 1/2/3 reserve mods. On controller, you're going to find the recoil difficult - Arrowhead Brake is the obvious choice as the barrel perk to straighten recoil direction, and the additional Handling is useful on M+KB too. Controllers might even benefit from Steady Rounds as the magazine perk too, but if you can keep to short, controlled bursts (like Cpl Hicks advises) then use Extended Magazine to increase mag size. As your trait perk combination, there's Slideways to reload by sliding (boosting handling and stability for a few seconds too) to keep Killing Tally's up to a ×1.35 damage boost going by bypassing manual reloads. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

Controllers might even benefit from Steady Rounds as the magazine perk too, but if you can keep to short, controlled bursts (like Cpl Hicks advises) then use Extended Magazine to increase mag size.

// Breachlight (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), (Demolitionist, Pugilist, Threat Detector), Desperate Measures
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. Desperate Measures is a really strong second trait column damage perk, providing up to a ×1.3 boost for Guardians that actively use their abilities, and is very easy to proc while transcendent. To pair with that, in the first column, Demolitionist and Pugilist look like natural partners, or if gunfeel is more important to you Threat Detector should be proccing constantly. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage. If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves.

// Breachlight (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), Slice, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility pick for use against major and boss enemies in end-game content, particularly with Strand builds. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by -40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune). This sets up Strand Tangle creation to proc the ×1.2 damage for 7s from Collective Action in the second column. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage. If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves.

// Patron of Lost Causes (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifles), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), Rapid Hit (Kinetic Tremors, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor in end-game content. Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. In the first trait perk column, Rapid Hit helps with both recoil control and reload on crit hits, while to boost damage, Kinetic Tremors is good for a bit of flinch and AoE damage after 6 hits, or Explosive Payload does much the same job is a smaller area. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Perfect Paradox is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid burst damage shotgun to help with beefier minors, majors and champions. It's a rapid-fire frame, so you get better reserves and a reload boost when empty (however, with available traits, you probably won't be manually reloading a lot). Its stats are decent at base - 32 Range equates to 4.71m, 43 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.35s ADS speed and 0.43s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 64 is a 0.48s per individual reload. You can boost handling with Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling as the barrel perk or Full Choke controls pellet spread a bit. Not having to worry about manual reloading, you can add a little range with the magazine perk instead. Then, for a burst damage weapon, Field Prep when enhanced maximises your total ammo without having to use any reserves or Slideshot in the first trait perk column provides one way to reload, by sliding (and also boosts range by +20), combined with One-Two Punch, to double non-ranged melee damage. Using your 1-2P melee procs the Cast No Shadows origin trait, providing another way to top up the mag by 20%, and boosting handling for a sort time.

Blast Radius is probably the most important barrel perk stat to boost - you're firing at your feet or nearby mostly, so you want the wave as wide and long as possible. High Velocity Rounds is the best magazine perk, boosting Velocity and Reload Speed. In the first trait perk slots, Field Prep takes the total ammo to its maximum of 25, without the need for reserves mods, and speeds up reloads to 1.44s when procced, but Auto-Loading Holster means you're always ready to shoot or Envious Assassin overflows the magazine to get up to 3 in the mag after 11 kills with other weapons.

// Line in the Sand (first-choice PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Ionized Battery, (Rapid Hit, Clown Cartridge), Bait and Switch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game content. Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, with there being only one way to the maximum battery size of 7 shots, which is Ionized Battery and a Backup Mag mod (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s). In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. Pair one of those with Bait and Switch for a ×1.3 damage boost for 10s when procced. Unless you're using a ranged melee, you probably won't see much benefit from the Cast No Shadows origin trait which reloads, and boosts handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, the maximum battery size of 7 shots, can be achieved with Enhanced or Ionized Battery (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s), plus Backup Mag and the Reservoir Burst trait. In the first trait perk slot, for burst damage, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. Reservoir Burst will apply a ×1.25 damage boost to the first 2-5 shots, and proc an explosion on a kill for chunky AoE damage. Unless you're using a ranged melee, you probably won't see much benefit from the Cast No Shadows origin trait which reloads, and boosts handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.
