@title:Episode 125 - Garden of Salvation weapons drop 
@description:Reprised weapons from the Garden of Salvation raid, with the Photoinhibition origin trait

// Accrued Redemption (first-choice PvE)
// Elastic String, Straight Fletching, Archer's Tempo, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage to bulkier Minor adds, Majors and Champions in general, and end-game underleveled content. Accrued Redemption's trait perk pool is mostly PvP-oriented, but there's still an excellent roll to shape for use against Champions. At base the stats are solid - Draw Time is standard 0.684ms, 43 Stability equates to a Perfect Draw time of 0.43s, 55 Handling is a 0.58s ready, 0.43s ADS and 0.44s stow time, and 40 Reload Speed is a 0.73s reload. There's no reason to look far beyond the standard Elastic String as the bowstring perk and Straight Fletching as the arrow perk to reduce the draw time and recover the accuracy malus. The trait perk combination of Archer's Tempo and Kinetic Tremors will make this a great anti-champion weapon with the matching bow Artifact mod. Kinetic Tremors has the second highest combatant damage multiplier on bows and, when enhanced, only needs two hits to proc, so is just free damage against champions once stunned, as well as clearing ads in the area. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create power orbs.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Although the Sacred Provenance Aggressive Burst subfamily isn't top tier for pulse rifle PvE damage, it wouldn't take too much to make them shine so it's worth keeping a good roll, just in case. At base the stats are good - 69 Range equates to 38.12m when ADS and 21.18m hipfire, 24 Handling is a 0.47s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.46s stow time, and 36 Reload Speed is a 2.12s reload. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk deals with the wonky Recoil Direction of 70 and adds Handling. High-Caliber Rounds adds useful flinch or Armor-Piercing Rounds works well to the origin trait against shielded enemies. As the trait perk pairing the SOFA (Stats for All + One for All) roll is always worthwhile, filling in gunfeel stats and boosting damage by ×1.35 for 10s. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

High-Caliber Rounds adds useful flinch or Armor-Piercing Rounds works well to the origin trait against shielded enemies. For a general purpose roll, Demolitionist in the first trait perk column is always fun and can be paired in the second with Frenzy, which maxes out the stat gaps nicely as well as boosting damage by ×1.15, or Desperate Measures for up to ×1.3 damage by using all your extra grenades.

// Ancient Gospel (first-choice PvE)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Accurized Rounds), Destabilizing Rounds, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Minor PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing minor enemies in general, and end-game underleveled content. Ancient Gospel returns as, for some reason, a void adaptive hand cannon this time with a whole load of PvP trait perks, but not much for PvE fans. At base the stats are solid - 41 Range equates to 29.54m when ADS and 19.69m hipfire, 46 Handling is a 0.34s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.38s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 2.69s reload. Recoil Direction is a perfect 100. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out your preferred stats - you might lean into Range or Handling for the barrel, and Range or Reload Speed with the magazine. There's really only one PvE trait perk roll pairing that works - Destabilizing Rounds and Explosive Payload - also useful against Overload Champions in particular, needing only two shots to disrupt when the artifact mod is around. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s. Recommended MW: Any, depending on personal preference, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-Minor PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Omniscient Eye (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal rifling), Tactical Mag, (Lead froom Gold, Fourth Time's the Charm, Envious Arsenal), (Vorpal Weapon, Precision Instrument)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for special weapon sustained damage against bosses in general, and end-game underleveled content. Omniscient Eye is a decent choice as a backup damage option against bosses once you're out of heavy ammo. At base the stats are good - 70 Handling equates to a 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow time, and 67 Reload Speed is a 2.74s reload (2.19s with the rapid-fire reload boost is you're reloading an empty magazine). Recoil Direction is a vertical, if loose, 55, magazine size is 6 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 28/30/33/34 (max 41). To land shots, a little extra control is nice - Arrowhead Brake will tighten up the recoil or Polygonal Rifling will reduce bounce as the barrel perk. Tactical Mag will maximise the magazine size and increase total ammo to near maximum levels. As trait perks, in the first column, Lead From Gold improves with your ammo economy, Fourth Time's the Charm will hit 11 crits without reloading assuming a mag of 7 shots, or Envious Arsenal is useful when enhanced to maximise reserves (the main perk probably won't be useful as you'll likely have run out of heavy ammo so won't be able to proc the main perk). In the second column Vorpal Weapon offers a flat ×1.15 damage bonus against bosses or, for longer damage phases, Precision Instrument is ×1.2 damage for the rest of the magazine once you've hit 4 quick crits. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

// Prophet of Doom (first-choice PvE)
// Full Choke, Assault Mag, (Reconstruction, Pugilist), One-Two Punc Punch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for special weapon burst damage against Majors and Champions in general, and end-game underleveled content. Prophet of Doom joins the rather large list of decent raid shotguns, so if you already have one, you might consider passing. At base the stats are good - 67 Range equates to 5.74m, 35 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.45s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 0.76s reload per shell. As it's a precision frame, you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, magazine size is 5 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). If you're still looking for a burst damage weapon, you have One-Two Punch available in the second trait perk column for ×2 melee (once that make director contact with enemies, anyway) ability damage and ×2.5 against bosses and vehicles for 1.22s. Full Choke as the barrel perk makes hitting all your pellets slightly easier and Assault Mag speeds up follow-up shots as the mag perk. Together with One-Two Punch, Reconstruction overflows your magazine passively over time or Pugilist returns 20% melee energy on shotgun kills (although you're more likely to get your kills with your melee so it might be slightly less useful here). The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

// Reckless Oracle (first-choice PvE)
// Arrowhead Brake, (High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds), Destabilizing Rounds, One for All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Minor PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing groups of Minors in general, and end-game underleveled content. As a rapid-fire AR, Reckless Oracle is in a good subfamily for damage output, and reloads with a ×0.8 animation scalar when empty. At base the stats are middling - 26 Range equates to 22.40m when ADS and 14.00m hipfire, 42 Handling equates to a 0.40s ready, 0.31s ADS and 0.37s stow time, and 55 Reload Speed is a 1.73s reload. You'll need to control the frankly awful recoil direction of 59 - Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk is the best way of doing that. High-Caliber Rounds works well on rapid-fires for extra flinch, or Armor-Piercing Rounds synergises with the origin trait when there's an AR anti-barrier mod in the seasonal artifact. To deal with groups of adds, the trait perk combination of Destabilizing Rounds and One for All provides a damage boost of ×1.35 for 10s, useful for dealing with bulkier adds, as well as spreading volatility on kills. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

High-Caliber Rounds works well on rapid-fires for extra flinch, or Armor-Piercing Rounds synergises with the origin trait when there's an AR anti-barrier mod in the seasonal artifact. As a trait perk pairing, Demolitionist and Paracausal Affinity forms a natural play loop on light-based subclasses.

// Zealot's Reward (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Particle Repeater, Projection Fuse), Subsistence, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing groups of Minors in general, and end-game underleveled content. As a rapid-fire FR, Zealot's Reward is in a good subfamily for damage output, and reloads with a ×0.8 animation scalar when empty. At base the stats are solid, apart from having lower ammo reserves - 22 Range equates to 15.10m when ADS and 11.62m hipfire, 56 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.28s stow time, and 48 Reload Speed is a 2.02s reload. The battery has 7 shots (8 max) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, total ammo is 19/21/24/25 (max 25). To land all your bolts, you'll need to control the terrible 49 recoil direction wit your barrel perk - Arrowhead Brake is the best way of doing that on controller, although you can probably get away with Fluted Barrel on M+KB. You can control the recoil further with Particle Repeater or push out the range with Projection Fuse as the battery perk. For clearing groups of adds, the trait perk combination of Subsistence to reload a shot (2 when enhanced) on kills, and Reservoir Burst for a ×1.25 damage boost and AoE detonation on kill, as well as maximising the battery size to 8, work well. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

// Zealot's Reward (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Particle Repeater, Projection Fuse), Destabilizing Rounds, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing groups of Minors in general, and end-game underleveled content. As a rapid-fire FR, Zealot's Reward is in a good subfamily for damage output, and reloads with a ×0.8 animation scalar when empty. At base the stats are solid, apart from having lower ammo reserves - 22 Range equates to 15.10m when ADS and 11.62m hipfire, 56 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.28s stow time, and 48 Reload Speed is a 2.02s reload. The battery has 7 shots (8 max) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, total ammo is 19/21/24/25 (max 25). To land all your bolts, you'll need to control the terrible 49 recoil direction wit your barrel perk - Arrowhead Brake is the best way of doing that on controller, although you can probably get away with Fluted Barrel on M+KB. You can control the recoil further with Particle Repeater or push out the range with Projection Fuse as the battery perk. For clearing groups of adds, the trait perk combination of Destabilizing Rounds to spread volatility on kills, and Reservoir Burst for a ×1.25 damage boost and AoE detonation on kill, as well as maximising the battery size to 8, work well. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

As a rapid-fire FR, Zealot's Reward is in a good subfamily for damage output, and reloads with a ×0.8 animation scalar when empty. At base the stats are solid, apart from having lower ammo reserves - 22 Range equates to 15.10m when ADS and 11.62m hipfire, 56 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.28s stow time, and 48 Reload Speed is a 2.02s reload.

Enhanced Battery is all you need as a battery perk to get to the max size of 8. For major and boss damage, Lead From Gold helps with your ammo economy and Controlled Burst provides ×1.2 damage and ×0.9 Charge Time for better DPS.
