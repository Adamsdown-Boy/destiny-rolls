= Core Tags =
Tags will be typed as CamelCase to prevent ambiguity.

== Mandatory Core Roll Types ==
All weapon rolls must be identified as either PvE or PvP. 

PvE - weapon rolls recommended by that list-maker for use in PvE activities

PvP - weapon rolls recommended by that list-maker for use in PvP activities

=== Optional additional core PvE tags ===
These tags may be used optionally for PvE weapons, in addition to the Mandatory Core Roll Type, at the discretion of the list-maker.

PvE-Boss - a subset of perks on a PvE weapon, selected by that list-maker as strong for Major and/or Boss (as defined by the relevant Spec mod description) damage

PvE-God - a subset of perks on a PvE weapon that are deemed the best-possible option(s) in each perk column by that list-maker. This is a judgement made against each individual weapon, not whether the weapn itself is considered S-Tier.

== Mandatory Core Input Methods ==
All weapon rolls must be identified as suitable for Controller and/or Mouse and Keyboard input device. If an input device is not specified, the default value is Controller.

Controller - weapon roll considered suitable for use with controller

MKB - weapon roll considered suitable for use with mouse and keyboard
