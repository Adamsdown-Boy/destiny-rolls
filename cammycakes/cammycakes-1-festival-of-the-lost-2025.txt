title:CammyCakes Gaming Festival of the Lost 2025 weapons
description:Ash and Iron Season 27 "Reclamation" Festival of the Lost weapons with the Search Party origin trait, discussed in the "Festival of The Lost Loot ||| God Roll Guide (PvP)" video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAt2aKQRgMA&t=623s).

// Gunburn - PvP Kill-chaining Good 1
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Bewildering Burst), (Target Lock, Kinetic Tremors)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for kill-chaining in 6v6 game modes, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX. Gunburn is a lightweight SMG, so you'll get the +20 to Mobility and ×1.0625 forward movement speed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (11c 1b) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.867s (9c 5b). The stats, particularly when you compare them to best in slot options like Multimach - particularly the one less zoom - are around 5 points lower, but you do have slightly better Airborne Effectiveness and enhanceable barrel and magazine perks at Tier 4 and 5 to narrow the gap. Even though Range is quite compressed, you'll want to push it out to be competitive - the Handling is high enough to consider Extended Barrel, which also maxes out Recoil Direction, or Hammer-Forged Rifling. Combine that with Accurized Rounds as the magazine perk and a Range Masterwork and mod, and you take the ADS range from 16.70m before damage dropoff up to 20.34m. You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. The unique trait perk is Bewildering Burst, which isn't easy to incorporate. Reloading after killing an opponent prepares a disorienting grenade to launch a flashbang above the next target, which detonates to disorient enemies in a 9m radius. On an SMG that means you'll need to jiggle peek out from cover to hit an opponent, back into cover for the flashbang, and then re-engage once they're blinded. In the second column, Target Lock effectively extends useful range, and makes missing a crit less punishing, or Kinetic Tremors is triggered after 14 hits for additional target and AoE damage. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed. Recommended MW: Range, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost Range, Zoom or Airborne Effectiveness depending ou your play style.|tags:PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller

// Gunburn - PvP Kill-chaining Good 2
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Pugilist), (Binary Orbit, Wellspring)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for kill-chaining in 6v6 game modes wit ha melee build, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX.

You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. For melee builds, Pugilist generates chunks of melee ability energy on kills. On light based subclasses, you can use melee kills to proc Binary Orbit which is like a better Harmony, boosting damage by ×1.25 for 8.5s on ability and weapon kills of the opposite energy type. Alternatively, if you're looking to go all-in to a melee build and need a legendary Monte Carlo, Wellspring generates additional chunk ability energy, shared between any uncharged abilities. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed.

// Gunburn - PvP Duelling Good 1
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Lone Wolf, Threat Detector), (Target Lock, Kinetic Tremors)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-Duel M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for duelling in 3v3 game modes, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX. Gunburn is a lightweight SMG, so you'll get the +20 to Mobility and ×1.0625 forward movement speed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (11c 1b) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.867s (9c 5b).

You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. For duelling, in the first trait perk column, Lone Wolf is great for flanking, and the gunfeel boosts scale multiplicatively with the Search Party origin trait, or Threat Detector provides information on enemies close by when ADSed (except when they're invisible), as well as usefully boosting Handling, Stability and Reload Speed. In the second column, Target Lock effectively extends useful range, and makes missing a crit less punishing, or Kinetic Tremors is triggered after 14 hits for additional target and AoE damage. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed.
