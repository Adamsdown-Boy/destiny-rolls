// Forgiveness - PvP Duelling god 1
// (Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator), (Ricochet Rounds), (Zen Moment, Tap the Trigger), (Precision Instrument)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-Duel PvP-God M+KB Controller): God-roll PvP roll for duelling - even with the Ash and Iron nerf, Forgiveness is still an excellent close range primary option. The Heavy Burst frame can be useful in reducing flinch when ADSed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (4 crits 1 body) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.833s (2c 4b). This pairs well with the Hunter Mask of Bakris ×1.06 damage boost for 11s after a shift, which reduces accuracy needed to 3c 2b. The stats, are generally better than its recent peers, except for lower range attribute - but this has less effect with the compressed range on sidearms. For the barrel perk, Corkscrew Rifling bumps up the major gunfeel attributes, or you can take Recoil Direction to 100 with either Extended Barrel or Chambered Compensator. Ricochet Rounds is the best of the magazine perks - you can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/1552443158 for yourself. Look for a consistency perk in the first trait perk column to help with crits. Zen Moment, stacks up to ×5 on hits to reduce flinch and visual shake - very useful on controllers. There's also Tap the Trigger which for 0.6s (0.76s when enhanced) on a trigger pull provides +40 Stability, ×0.5 recoil and ×0.9 Accuracy Cone size. In the second column, Precision Instrument grants escalating damage on repeated crit hits up to ×1.25 at ×6 stacks (×1.3 when enhanced) for 1.25s or until you miss a crit. Mask of Bakris and Precision Instrument together reduce the TTK to 0.47 (4c 0b). For the Origin Trait, Fleet Footed stacks up to ×1 on hits and ×2 on kills to boost movement speed and Airborne Effectiveness - great for a mobile playstyle - or Roar of Battle grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost Range, Handling, Airborne Effectiveness depending on your play style.|tags:PvP PvP-Duel PvP-God M+KB Controller

// Forgiveness - PvP Kill-chaining good 1
// (Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator), (Ricochet Rounds), (Voltshot), (Precision Instrument, Kill Clip)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-KillChain PvP-God M+KB Controller): Fun PvP roll for kill-chaining in non-competitive matches. Even with the Ash and Iron nerf, Forgiveness is still an excellent close range primary option, and the Heavy Burst frame can be useful in reducing flinch when ADSed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (4 crits 1 body) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.833s (2c 4b).

Ricochet Rounds is the best of the magazine perks - you can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/1552443158 for yourself. In 6s matches, you can have fun with Voltshot in the first trait perk column to apply Jolt to the next target you hit within 7s (8s when enhanced), after a reload within 5.3s of a kill, for additional damage to the target on further hits plus AoE chain lightning damage on nearby opponents. In the second column, to help with kill-chaining, both Precision Instrument which grants escalating damage on repeated crit hits up to ×1.25 at ×6 stacks (×1.3 when enhanced) for 1.25s or until you miss a crit, or Kill Clip that boosts damage by ×1.25 for 5s (5.5s enhanced) when you reload within 3.6s of a kill, can reduce TTK to 0.47s (3c 1b).
