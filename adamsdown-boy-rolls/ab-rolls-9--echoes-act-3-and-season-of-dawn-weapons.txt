// PvE podcast ep115 Solstice weapons additional rolls

// Chronophage (first-choice PvE)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), (Particle Repeater, Light Battery), Shoot to Loot, (One For All, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content, particularly with void builds. Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17 and, unfortunately its stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Backup Mag on its own added gets you to the maximum of 461 (513/565/591), so you can opt for Particle Repeater for more stability, or Light Battery for Handling and Reload Speed. For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait perk is always useful to pick up ammo blocks and power orbs, but also helpfully reloads all your weapons. In the second, One for All provides an easy to proc a ×1.35 damage boost, or Desperate Measures is easy to proc while Transcendent with grenade and melee kills, for up to a ×1.3 boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? For anyone interested, the name's derived from Greek words "chronos" and "phage", literally meaning "time-eater" and is used colloquially in French to mean "time-consuming".

// Speleologist (first-choice PvE)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Steady Rounds, Extended Magazine), Envious Assassin, Killing Tally
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content. Speleologist's stats are on the low side, unfortunately, but there are still some very usable rolls. At base, 28 Range equates to 46.60m while ADS, 49 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.40s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 61 is a 4.59s reload. Total ammo is 514 total out of the box - which is pretty much the ceiling - increasing to 583/652/687 with 1/2/3 reserve mods. On controller, you're going to find the recoil difficult - Arrowhead Brake is the obvious choice as the barrel perk to straighten recoil direction, and the additional Handling is useful on M+KB too. Controllers might even benefit from Steady Rounds as the magazine perk too, but if you can keep to short, controlled bursts (like Cpl Hicks advises) then use Extended Magazine to increase mag size. As your trait perk combination, Envious Assassin works quietly in the background to overfill your magazine by up to 200%, depending on the circumstances, giving you plenty of ammo to use with Killing Tally's up to a ×1.3 damage boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves.

// Breachlight (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), Slice, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE utility pick for use against major and boss enemies in end-game content, particularly with Strand builds. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by 40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune). In the second column Vorpal Weapon boosts damage by ×1.2 against majors and bosses with no proccing, which makes this an excellent choice for use in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

// Patron of Lost Causes (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifles), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), Triple Tap (Precision Instrument, Focused Fury)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add clearing Minor in end-game content. Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. If you're able to hit consistent crits, the trait perk combination of Triple Tap and either Precision Instrument or Focused Fury will help keep the higher damage stacks up for longer before reloading. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

// Line in the Sand (first-choice PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Ionized Battery, (Rapid Hit, Clown Cartridge), Firing Line
// Line in the Sand (first-choice PvE)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game content. Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, with there being only one way to the maximum battery size of 7 shots, which is Ionized Battery and a Backup Mag mod (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s). In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. For an easy ×1.2 damage boost with easy proccing conditions (just stand near your fireteam), Firing Line is still a decent choice. Unless you're using a ranged melee, you probably won't see much benefit from the Cast No Shadows origin trait which reloads, and boosts handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.
