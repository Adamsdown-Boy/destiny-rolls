// Ideas for exotic class items and Ergo Sum rolls

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of the Stag, Spirit of Harmony
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Maybe one for the Vault for now - this is just in case Well of Radiance ever gets a little love. How likely that is, you can decide! It's a pretty simple concept - Harmony solar kills get your super back faster - pair it with No Hesitation and a couple of other Pale Heart weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin perks, and you should have a super for every boss damage phase. With Stag, everyone in the Well gets resist x2 for -25% damage resistance - and while that isn't enough on its own to survive when you're underlevelled, it should be good enough in general, at-level, content. And, seeing as you're asking, Solipsism is a philisophical theory holding that only one's mind is certain to exist.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades. And, seeing as you're asking, Solipsism is a philisophical theory holding that only one's mind is certain to exist.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of the Necrotic, Spirit of the Claw;
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for melee-focussed builds, but there's also some synergy with the Weapons of Sorrow and glaive lovers. It's pretty simple - Claw provides an additional melee charge, Necrotic melees poison enemies and killing poisoned enemies spreads the poison. The additional damage isn't huge, but it prevents shield regeneration and lets you keep track of an enemy's position. Necrotic also works with glaive melee attacks (so you might want to bring one with the "Close to Melee" trait perk) and Weapons of Sorrow, and Claw also works with the Song of Flame exotic to give you two finger snaps. Alongside this in a prismatic build, Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges at base, and four with Claw and you can choose pretty much any grenade. For Aspects, Feed the Void will proc Devour on an ability kill, paired with Lightning Surge to use melee charges to Jolt enemies or Hellion for solar scorching and kills. Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Blessing play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Jolt or the Hellion mortar), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), Blessing starts health regeneration on melee kills, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), and Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more Jolt/Hellion damage against frozen/unravelled enemies).

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of the Stag, Spirit of Vesper
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): Want to feel even more safe in your rift? Stag and Vesper is a simple, proc-free combination to drop your rift while Ghost decrypts the same code its been working on for the last 10 years in the Devil's Lair, and gain x2 Resist for a damage reduction of -25% with Horn, and send out a regular arc shockwave to dissuade any meleeing enemies with nefarious intentions with Vesper. If you want to summon a personal army while you're there, the Hellion and Weaver's Call Aspects both proc on a rift cast. Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges which apply strand unravelling to enemies, and the grenade if dealer's choice - Healing Grenade if you want another source of healing, Coldsnap if you want a source of darkness debuff, or Storm or Vortex to damage enemies. Alongside those you might consider Facets of Sacrifice to generate bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills while you have light elemental buff, Devotion to grant bonus light transcendent energy ftom killing enemies debuffed by darkness debuffs, Hope to recover ability energy while you have an elemental buff, Purpose to provide an elemental buff on power orb pickup, and Protection to give you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent). You could swap out Devotion for Courage to provide bonus damage from light abilities to enemies with a darkness debuff, or Dominance to improve arc/void grenades. And, seeing as you're asking, Solipsism is a philisophical theory holding that only one's mind is certain to exist.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller
