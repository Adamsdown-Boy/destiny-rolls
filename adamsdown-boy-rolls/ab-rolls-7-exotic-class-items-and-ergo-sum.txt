// Ideas for exotic class items and Ergo Sum rolls

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of the Stag, Spirit of Harmony
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE / PvE-Utility / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): Maybe one for the Vault for now - this is just in case Well of Radiance ever gets a little love. How likely that is, you can decide! It's a pretty simple concept - Harmony solar kills get your super back faster - pair it with No Hesitation and a couple of other Pale Heart weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin perks, and you should have a super for every boss damage phase. With Stag, everyone in the Well gets resist x2 for -25% damage resistance - and while that isn't enough on its own to survive when you're underlevelled, it should be good enough in general, at-level, content.
