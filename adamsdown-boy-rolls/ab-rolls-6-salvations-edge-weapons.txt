// PvE podcast ep111 Salvation's Edge additional rolls

// Critical Anomaly (PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Extended Mag, Chill Clip, Explosive Payload
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-Utility / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use. Shapeable. Base stats are excellent by comparison to its peers, and equate to 0.45s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.39s stow speed, and 3.30s reload speed. Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - so Fluted Barrel is the barrel perk to choose, and Arrowhead Brake is decent. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots (so maybe a reload mod on your boots will help?). That's important for Chill Clip in the first trait slot, as it means you'll have three Chill Clip shots. For anti-Champion use, one shot will slow and disrupt an Overload champion and two will freeze and stun an Unstoppable (with a third stot ready, just in case). You can also pierce barriers by simply becoming radiant, and all at a nice, safe range. The second column trait is less important as this is more of a utility roll, but Chaos Reshaped is likely to have built up two stacks in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost, or Explosive Payload provides a small damage boost without any proccing needed. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Critical Anomaly (PvE)

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-Boss/ PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use. Shapeable. Base stats are excellent by comparison to its peers, and equate to 0.45s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.39s stow speed, and 3.30s reload speed. Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - Arrowhead Brake boosts recoil direction to 100, and adds 10 to Handling. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots. You can double this with Reconstruction in the first trait column and then, for a backup boss damage weapon in the second column, Chaos Reshaped is likely to have built up two stacks in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost, or Firing Line provides an easy +20% to damage just for standing near your fireteam. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Critical Anomaly (Adept) (first-choice PvE)
// Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Chill Clip, Chaos Reshaped
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-Utility / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use. Shapeable. Base stats are excellent by comparison to its peers, and equate to 0.45s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.39s stow speed, and 3.30s reload speed. Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - so Fluted Barrel is the barrel perk to choose, and Arrowhead Brake is decent. Tactical Mag plus an Adept Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots (and boosts a couple of useful stats a little). That's important for Chill Clip in the first trait slot, as it means you'll have three Chill Clip shots. For anti-Champion use, one shot will slow and disrupt an Overload champion and two will freeze and stun an Unstoppable (with a third stot ready, just in case).

// Non-Denouement (PvE)
// (Flexible String, Polymer String), Straight Fletching, (Archer's Tempo, Dragonfly), Voltshot
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-Boss/ PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec red-bar adds in end-game content, particularly with an arc build. Shapeable. Non-Dénouement is French for "No final outcome" - make of that what you will! Base stats are good by comparison to its peers, and equate to a 0.622s draw time, 0.42s perfect draw window, 0.43s ADS speed, 0.58s ready and 0.44s stow speed, and 0.78s reload speed. As with most bows, the bowstring and arrow perks will reduce the draw time and improve accuracy. The roll that everyone's looking for is the "baby" Trinity Ghoul, with Voltshot in the second trait column for jolting and chaining arc damage - which you can improve on with arc aspects and fragments. To pair with this in the first column, Archer's Tempo is reliable as ever, reducing draw time further after a crit hit but, if you're after all the explosions, Dragonfly is there too. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers a small boost draw speed, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.

If you don't already have an arc bow for end-game use, in the first column Archer's Tempo is reliable as ever, reducing draw time further, or Shoot to Loot is handy to pick up remote ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons. If you're after all the explosions, Dragonfly is there too. In the second column, Explosive Head adds a little extra damage and AoE - which will also pick up ammo bricks with Shoot to Loot.
