// Solipsism (PvE)
// (Spirit of Inmost Light, Spirit of Osmiomancy), Spirit of the Swarm
//notes:Rolls published by u/engineeeeer7 and rated as 5/5 in the linked spreadsheet at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dz5sj5/exotic_class_item_planner_and_reference/ (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): One for Strand builds that aim to maximise Threadling generation in general content. The play loop is pretty simple - use Inmost Light to empower your abilities and speed up regeneration, or Osmiomancy to boost grenade regeneration and then use them (and weapons) to create Tangles which generate Threadlings when they're destroyed, through Swarm. If you're going all in to an army of Threadlings build, the Weaver's Call aspect is an obvious choice, and you'll probably want Facet of Honor, Awakening and maybe Solitude to create more Tangles and benefit from destroying them, or your own choice of fragments to boost the utility of your grenade, melee and rift, and gameplay preferences. And, seeing as you're asking, Solipsism is a philosophical theory holding that only one's own mind can be certain to exist.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller

You'll want an AoE grenade for maximum effect on Osmiomancy, and then it's pretty much dealer's choice on weapons, super, aspects and fragments to support your gameplay preferences - maybe an AoE grenade like Vortex with the Feed the Void aspect to proc Devour, and Facets of Bravery for void weapon volatile rounds and Dominance to weaken enemies with grenades too?

// Relativism (first-choice PvE)

// Relativism (PvE)
// (Spirit of the Assassin, Spirit of Inmost Light), Spirit of Synthoceps
//notes:Rolls published by u/engineeeeer7 and rated as 5/5 in the linked spreadsheet at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dz5sj5/exotic_class_item_planner_and_reference/ (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): One to help reclaim punchy-punchy builds from Titans, with a pretty simple gameplay loop - Synthoceps increases your melee damage by ×3 for 6s when you have 3+ enemies nearby, while either Assassin makes you invisible on a melee or finisher kill or Inmost Light improves your abilities and regen rate as you use them. This cries out for use with the Gambler's Dodge class ability to keep you punching, dodging and regenerating health, the Combination Blow melee, Grapple grenade, and Winter's Shroud and Stylish Executioner aspects for a pretty much one-Guardian army (while there are Minor adds to kill, anyway), although be warned that sometimes the damage can be confusingly inconsistent. You'll almost certainly need Facets of Dawn, Protection and Blessing to boost DR, healing and damage further with your CQC melee gameplay. And, seeing as you're asking, Relativism is a philosophical theory that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Rolls published by u/engineeeeer7 and rated as 5/5 in the linked spreadsheet at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dz5sj5/exotic_class_item_planner_and_reference/ (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): This is a trait combination for grenade builds for everyday use - something to throw on that will just work in the background without too much effort. One the one hand, Inmost Light will boost abilities and regeneration time just by using them, while Verity can boost grenade damage by up to ×2 on matching weapon damage. Pretty much super, ability, aspect and fragment agnostic (although your weapon elemental damage type will need to match your grenade), so you can just use them to flesh out your preferred gameplay style.

// Spirit of the Foetracer, Spirit of the Star-Eater
//notes:Rolls published by u/engineeeeer7 and rated as 5/5 in the linked spreadsheet at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dz5sj5/exotic_class_item_planner_and_reference/ (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): A great trait combination to use for burst boss damage - Star-Eater boosts super damage by up to ×1.7 on picking up power orbs and then once out of your super you'll get ×1.25 boost to matching elemental damage for 10s (which can be reprocced by damaging the boss with another matching ability). Ideally you'll need a burst damage super like Storm's Edge and then swap to your arc boss damage weapon of choice. As this is aimed at boss damage, you can choose your abilities, aspects and fragments to support your preferred gameplay objectives.

Neither boosts grenade ability recharge rate, so you might want to look at a matching element weapon with the Demolitionist trait, and/or using aspects and fragments that do the same, or which improve your grenade use further.

To regain grenade energy quickly after your super ends, you might look at Facets of Balance (to use with a Stasis/Strand primary weapon), and maybe also Courage to boost damage for a Gathering Storm super, but otherwise melee, aspects and fragments can be used to support your gameplay objectives.

Pretty much super, ability, aspect and fragment agnostic, so you can just use them to flesh out your preferred gameplay style.

Pretty much super, ability, aspect and fragment agnostic as long as you have a matching weapon to proc Scars, so you can just use them to flesh out your preferred gameplay style.

Your build will focus on grenade ability regeneration, to use with Unbreakable, and super damage - so Facets of Courage, for additional ability damage against darkness-debuffed targets, Balance, to boost to grenade energy on darkness kills, Purpose, for DR or healing on an orb pickup, and Solitude to sever targets to use with Courage all look like useful additions to the kit, together with a Stasis or Strand Demolitionist weapon and a Light-based super.
