@description:Additional PvE Podcast 153 Part 1 rolls that extend the roll lists, or rolls that weren't included

// Trachinus - PvE Boss god AB 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), (Lead From Gold, Rapid Hit), (Precision Instrument)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written as at v9.0.0.8 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Elites, Banes, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Trachinus is the first of a new slug shotgun subfamily - rapid-frime frames. Unfortunately, the intrinsic is bugged and the ×0.8 reload animation scalar from an empty mag only seems to work on the first shell reloaded. It's also the new highest damage output subfamily for shotguns. There aren't really any peers to assess against, but the stats look good, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and mag perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3635232671 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base Magazine Size is 7 (max 8) and total ammo is 26. You can use the barrel perk to improve Handling and, at time of writing, Assault Mag is boosting RPM by +50 rather than the usual +5 - so have fun until someone deletes the errant "0". When that's corrected, a magazine perk that boosts mag size is probably the play. There aren't any reload options in the first trait perk column - although the Tenacity Origin Trait can max out Reload Speed after 14 kills - so Lead from Gold to generate 25% of your special ammo reserves when you pick up heavy bricks looks good. Rapid Hit looks good on paper to help with reload, but seems bugged and only procs on the first shell reloaded. For damage, at least while the Assault Mag bug is active, repeated crit hits with Precision Instrument grant escalating damage up to ×1.25 at 6 stacks (×1.3 when enhanced) for 1.25s or until you miss a crit. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and an extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Veist Stinger which seems bugged at the time of writing, but which will provide probably ~4% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine when fixed. If you're interested, Trachinus is the taxonomic genus for weever fish, a type of venomous marine fish with a distinctive dorsal spine capable of inflicting painful stings, and comes from the Ancient Greek word τρᾱχύς (trachýs), meaning "rough". Recommended MW: Handling, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Trachinus - PvE Major god AB 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), (Proximity Power), (Swashbuckler)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written as at v9.0.0.8 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for applying Stasis Slow and Freeze in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with a melee build. Trachinus is the first of a new slug shotgun subfamily - rapid-frime frames, which provides the usual deeper reserves and ×0.8 animation scalar when reloading from empty. It's also the new highest damage output subfamily for shotguns. There aren't really any peers to assess against, but the stats look good, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and mag perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3635232671 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance.

You can use the barrel perk to improve Handling and, at time of writing, Assault Mag is boosting RPM by +50 rather than the usual +5 - so have fun until someone deletes the errant "0". When that's corrected, a magazine perk that boosts mag size is probably the play. There aren't any reload options in the first trait perk column - although the Tenacity Origin Trait can max out Reload Speed after 14 kills - so for a melee build, Proximity Power stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy is within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. For damage in the second column, Swashbuckler provides up to ×5 damage stacks on kills, up to ×1.33, with a melee kill giving 5 stacks, for a refreshable 4.5s (5s when enhanced). The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and an extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die.

When that's corrected, a magazine perk that boosts mag size is probably the play. There aren't any reload options in the first trait perk column - although the Tenacity Origin Trait can max out Reload Speed after 14 kills - so Lead from Gold to generate 25% of your special ammo reserves when you pick up heavy bricks looks good. Rapid Hit looks good on paper to help with reload, but seems bugged and only procs on the first shell reloaded. For damage, at least while the Assault Mag bug is active, repeated crit hits with Precision Instrument grant escalating damage up to ×1.25 at 6 stacks (×1.3 when enhanced) for 1.25s or until you miss a crit. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing +2.5 Handling and Reload Speed and an extra 0.5% damage per stack (max +50 Handling and Reload, and ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. There's also Veist Stinger which seems bugged at the time of writing, but which will provide probably ~4% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine when fixed. If you're interested, Trachinus is the taxonomic genus for weever fish, a type of venomous marine fish with a distinctive dorsal spine capable of inflicting painful stings, and comes from the Ancient Greek word τρᾱχύς (trachýs), meaning "rough".

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Minor add group control damage in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/1823308496 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is 66 (max 77). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing an extra 0.5% damage per stack (max ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. It also boosts Handling and Reload Speed with each stack, which aren't weapon attributes on a sword, so there may possibly be a small boost to Charge Rate. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 153 from 9 September 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iEksMDGzT5euNuMAEqnVm?si=a9bf49987cdb441a) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility roll for CQC Minor add group control damage in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Synanceia is a wave frame, so the heavy wave attack costs 4 ammo with an extra 1 for the optional targeted follow-up. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats look good - Impact and Charge Rate are both highest in the subfamily, and they're improved further at Tier 4/5 when blade and guard perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/2765451289 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. Base total ammo is 66 (max 77). Use the blade perk to maximise damage and Swordmaster's Guard guard perk improves Charge Rate by +10 for the heavy attack. You'll have to get up close and personal to control add groups with a sword, but if you are, then in the first trait perk column, Attrition Orbs spawns a power orb after 10 hits within 5s of each other to proc armor mods, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo if you get 3 hits within ~2s of each other (~2.5s when enhanced) to improve ammo economy. Also useful are Sharp Harvest to return 5% of special ammo reserves for 3 hits within ~1.5s (~2.0s when enhanced) and, on melee builds, Proximity Power which stacks up ×3 times to provide +15 (+18 when enhanced) to your Melee attribute per stack on kills when another enemy's within 15m - a total a +45 (+54) for a refreshable 10s on further kills, so you can invest stat points into other armour attributes. In the second column, Chain Reaction creates a solar 3m AoE explosion on kills to help clear add groups. The Tenacity Origin trait stacks up to ×20 on kills, providing an extra 0.5% damage per stack (max ×1.1 damage boost) until you die. It also boosts Handling and Reload Speed with each stack, which aren't weapon attributes on a sword, so there may possibly be a small boost to Charge Rate. There's also Häkke Breach Armaments - if you want to attack a tank, turret or Shrieker with a sword then good luck with that! If you're interested, Synanceia is the scientific genus for stonefish, which are venomous, marine ray-finned fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea. These fish are known for their camouflage, resembling rocks, and possess potent neurotoxins in their dorsal spines that can cause severe pain, paralysis, and even death in humans. Recommended MW: Impact, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller
