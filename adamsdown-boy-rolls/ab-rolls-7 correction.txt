// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades. And, seeing as you're asking, Solipsism is a philisophical theory holding that only one's mind is certain to exist.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller
