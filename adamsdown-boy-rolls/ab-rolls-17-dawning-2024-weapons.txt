@title:PvE podcast ep126 The Dawning weapons additional rolls
@description:Additional rolls that extend the podcast rolls, or rolls that weren't included

// Albedo Wing (PvE)
// (Auxilliary Reserves, Low-Impedence Windings), (Appended Mag,, Light Mag), Eddy Current, Collective Action
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for bulkier Minor adds and Majors in general, and end-game underleveled content. If you're into the glaive life, Albedo Wing provides some variety, being one of the few aggressive frames available. At base the stats are solid - 38 Range equates to 19.09m and a projectile speed of 117m/s, 35 Handling is a 0.35s ready and 0.42s stow time, 30 Shield Duration is 9.95s when fully charged and 30 Reload Speed is a 2.98s reload. Magazine size is 4 (max 6) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 25/28/32/34 (max 36). You can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can get around that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one or Light Mag improves things a little. In the first trait perk column, Eddy Current when procced speeds up reload and adds handling while Collective Action in the second boosts projectile damage by Ã—1.2 for picking up an elemental pickup - enhance this and add in the Synergy weapon mod to generate Ionic Traces and that should be happening plenty. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration. Recommended MW: Shield Duration, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Ionic Traces.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Zephyr (PvE)
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Cold Steel
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): Utility anti-champion PvE pick in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with stasis builds. Zephyr isn't quite as unique as it was when it appeared as the first stasis sword but it's still a useful addition to a vault for CQC boss encounters. All swords have pretty much the same base stats - except Bequest with its 70 Impact - so this stacks up decently by comparison. At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 67/71/73/74 (max 77). Choose a blade perk that boosts damage, and then the usual play is Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk to speed up heavy attack regeneration time for maximum damage. For anti-champion use, Relentless Strikes returns one ammo for every three hits while the Cold Steel slow will disrupt overload champions on one hit, stun Unstoppable champions after three hits freeze them, and pierce barrier champions if you apply radiant. You will have to be brave as you'll be up close. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod. or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Stasis shards.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Zephyr (first-choice PvE)
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), Swordmaster's Guard, Tireless Blade, (Surrounded, One for All, Chain reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 126 from 17 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6SVRlV4ttvPkAm9HA44Km0?si=a9d7a25536b747c3) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with stasis builds. Zephyr isn't quite as unique as it was when it appeared as the first stasis sword but it's still a useful addition to a vault for CQC boss encounters. All swords have pretty much the same base stats - except Bequest with its 70 Impact - so this stacks up decently by comparison. At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 67/71/73/74 (max 77). Choose a blade perk that boosts total ammo, and then the usual play is Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk to speed up heavy attack regeneration time for maximum damage. For add-clearing, Tireless Blade returns one ammo for every two kills in the first trait perk slot, while for damage in the second slot, Surrounded or One for All are both solid options, or Chain Reaction (even though the combatant damage multiplier isn't great) provides some AoE damage to soften targets up. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod. or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Stasis shards.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller
